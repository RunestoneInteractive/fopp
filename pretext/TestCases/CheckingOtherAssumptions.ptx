  <title>Checking Other Assumptions</title>
  <p>We can also check other assumptions about the values of variables, in addition to their types. For example, we could check that a list has fewer than 10 items.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac19_1b_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
lst = ['a', 'b', 'c']

assert len(lst) &lt; 10
        </input>
