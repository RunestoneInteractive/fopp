  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making
            errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.</p>
  <p>Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called <term>iteration</term>. Because iteration is so common, Python
            provides several language features to make it easier. We've already seen the <c>for</c> statement in a previous chapter.
            This is a very common form of iteration in Python. In this chapter we are going to look at the <c>while</c> statement &#x2014;
            another way to have your program do iteration.</p>
