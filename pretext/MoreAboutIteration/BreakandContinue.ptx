  <title>Break and Continue</title>
  <p>Python provides ways for us to control the flow of iteration with a two keywords: break and continue.</p>
  <p><c>break</c> allows the program to immediately &#x2018;break out' of the loop, regardless of the loop's conditional structure.
            This means that the program will then skip the rest of the iteration, without rechecking the condition, and just goes on
            to the next outdented code that exists after the whole while loop.</p>
  <image source="MoreAboutIteration/Figures/while_and_break.png" width="50%" alt="image showing a rectangle with &quot;code block&quot; written on it on top. Then, text that read &quot;while {condition}&quot;: followed by an indented block with &quot;...&quot; written on it. break is then written and another indented block is placed after the phrase break, which has &quot;... (skipped)&quot; written on it. Finally, an unindented block belonging to code outside the while loop is at the bottom. It says &quot;code block&quot;. An arrow points from the word break to the unindented block at the bottom and the phrase &quot;break out of the loop&quot; is written."/>
  <program xml:id="ac14_5_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
while True:
    print("this phrase will always print")
    break
    print("Does this phrase print?")

print("We are done with the while loop.")
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>We can see here how the print statement right after <c>break</c> is not executed. In fact, without using break, we have no
            way to stop the while loop because the condition is always set to True!</p>
  <p><c>continue</c> is the other keyword that can control the flow of iteration. Using <c>continue</c> allows the program to
            immediately <q>continue</q> with the next iteration. The program will skip the rest of the iteration, recheck the condition,
            and maybe does another iteration depending on the condition set for the while loop.</p>

(skipped)&quot; written on it. Finally, an unindented block belonging to code outside the while loop is at the bottom. It says &quot;code block&quot;. An arrow points from the word continue to the while conditional statement at the top of the while loop. The phrase &quot;continue at the start of the loop&quot; is written."/>
  <program xml:id="ac14_5_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
x = 0
while x &lt; 10:
    print("we are incrementing x")
    if x % 2 == 0:
        x += 3
        continue
    if x % 3 == 0:
        x += 5
    x += 1
print("Done with our loop! X has the value: " + str(x))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Try stepping through the above code in codelens to watch the order that the code is executed in. Notice in the first
            iteration how the program doesn't move to evaluate the divisible by 3 statment or add 1 to x. Instead, it continues to
            the next iteration.</p>
