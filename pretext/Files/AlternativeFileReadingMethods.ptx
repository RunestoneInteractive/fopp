  <title>Alternative File Reading Methods</title>
  <p>Once you have a file <q>object</q>, the thing returned by the open function, Python provides three methods to read data
            from that object. The <c>read()</c> method returns the entire contents of the file as a single string (or just some
            characters if you provide a number as an input parameter. The <c>readlines</c> method returns the entire contents of
            the entire file as a list of strings, where each item in the list is one line of the file. The <c>readline</c>
            method reads one line from the file and returns it as a string. The strings returned by <c>readlines</c> or
            <c>readline</c> will contain the newline character at the end.  <xref ref="files_filemethods2a"/> summarizes these
            methods and the following session shows them in action.</p>

                                <c>filevar</c> must refer to a file that has
                                been  opened for writing.

                                single string if  <c>n</c> is not provided.

                                newline character. If <c>n</c> is provided as
                                a parameter, then only <c>n</c> characters
                                will be returned if the line is longer
                                than <c>n</c>. <term>Note</term> the parameter <c>n</c> is not supported in the browser version of Python, and in fact is rarely used in practice, you can safely ignore it.

                                then <c>n</c> characters are read but <c>n</c> is
                                rounded up so that an entire line is
                                returned.  <term>Note</term> Like <c>readline</c> <c>readlines</c> ignores the parameter <c>n</c> in the browser.

  <p>In this course, we will generally either iterate through the lines returned by <c>readlines()</c> with a for loop,
            or use <c>read()</c> to get all of the contents as a single string.</p>
  <p>In other programming languages, where they don't have the convenient for loop method of going through the lines
            of the file one by one, they use a different pattern which requires a different kind of loop, the <c>while</c> loop.
            Fortunately, you don't need to learn this other pattern, and we will put off consideration of <c>while</c> loops
            until later in this course. We don't need them for handling data from files.</p>
  <note>
    <p>A common error that novice programmers make is not realizing that all these ways of reading the file contents,
                <term>use up the file</term>. After you call readlines(), if you call it again you'll get an empty list.</p>

Writing essays for school can be difficult but
many students find that by researching their topic that they
have more to say and are better informed. Here are the university
we require many undergraduate students to take a first year writing requirement
so that they can
have a solid foundation for their writing skills. This comes
in handy for many students.
Different schools have different requirements, but everyone uses
writing at some point in their academic career, be it essays, research papers,
technical write ups, or scripts.

This summer I will be travelling.
I will go to...
Italy: Rome
Greece: Athens
England: London, Manchester
France: Paris, Nice, Lyon
Spain: Madrid, Barcelona, Granada
Austria: Vienna
I will probably not even want to come back!
However, I wonder how I will get by with all the different languages.
I only know English!
