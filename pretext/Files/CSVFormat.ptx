  <title>CSV Format</title>
  <p>CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. If you print out tabular data in CSV format, it can be easily imported into other programs like Excel, Google spreadsheets, or a statistics package (R, stata, SPSS, etc.).</p>
  <p>For example, we can make a file with the following contents. If you save it as a file name grades.csv, then you could import it into one of those programs. The first line gives the column names and the later lines each give the data for one row.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
Name,score,grade
Jamal,98,A+
Eloise,87,B+
Madeline,99,A+
Wei,94,A
</input>
  </program>
