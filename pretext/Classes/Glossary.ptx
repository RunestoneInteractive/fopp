      <title>attribute</title>
      <p>One of the named data items that makes up an instance.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>class</title>
      <p>A user-defined compound type. A class can also be thought of as a
                            template for the objects that are instances of it.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>constructor</title>
      <p>Every class has a <q>factory</q>, called by the same name as the class, for
                            making new instances.  If the class has an <em>initializer method</em>, this method
                            is used to get the attributes (i.e. the state) of the new object properly set up.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>initializer method</title>
      <p>A special method in Python (called <c>__init__</c>)
                            that is invoked automatically to set a newly created object's
                            attributes to their initial (factory-default) state.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>instance</title>
      <p>An object whose type is of some class.  The words instance and object are used
                            interchangeably.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>instance variable</title>
      <p>A variable that stores a value associated with the instance. The instance variables together store the state of an instance.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>instantiate</title>
      <p>To create an instance of a class, and to run its initializer.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>method</title>
      <p>A function that is defined inside a class definition and is invoked on
                            instances of that class.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>object</title>
      <p>A compound data type that is often used to model a thing or concept in
                            the real world.  It bundles together the data and the operations that
                            are relevant for that kind of data.  Instance and object are used
                            interchangeably.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>object-oriented programming</title>
      <p>A powerful style of programming in which data and the operations
                            that manipulate it are organized into classes and methods.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>object-oriented language</title>
      <p>A language that provides features, such as user-defined classes and
                            inheritance, that facilitate object-oriented programming.</p>
