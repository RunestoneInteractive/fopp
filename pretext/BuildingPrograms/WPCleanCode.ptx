  <title>&#x1F469;&#x200D;&#x1F4BB; Clean Up</title>
  <p>Congrats! We've solved the problem now, but our code isn't very nice to read. We can clean it up now and remove the print statements.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac500_4_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
# initialize a dictionary
user_dictionary = {}

# write a for loop that will iterate five times. I can use the range function for this!
for _ in range(5):
    # in the for loop, I should ask for input from the user
    response = input("Please enter two words to add to a dictionary. The first word is the definition, the second will be the word associated with it.")

    # next, I should separate the words
    separated_response = response.split()
    response_key = separated_response[0]
    response_value = separated_response[1]

    # finally, I should add the key value pair to the dictionary
    user_dictionary[response_key] = response_value
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>We can also fix the comments so that they aren't so obvious.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac500_4_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
user_dictionary = {}

# asks a user for two words to add to the user dictionary - will do this five times.
# the first word will be the key, the second word will be the value.
for _ in range(5):
    response = input("Please enter two words to add to a dictionary. The first word is the definition, the second will be the word associated with it.")

    separated_response = response.split()
    response_key = separated_response[0]
    response_value = separated_response[1]

    user_dictionary[response_key] = response_value
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>At this point, the code has been cleaned up fully - you could easily write the comments in a different way but this should be easy for other programmers to understand, and ourselves to understand if we come back to the code days, weeks, or months later!</p>
