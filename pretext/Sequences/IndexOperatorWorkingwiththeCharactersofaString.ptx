  <title>Index Operator: Working with the Characters of a String</title>
  <p>The <term>indexing operator</term> (Python uses square brackets to enclose the index)
            selects a single character from a string.  The characters are accessed by their position or
            index value.  For example, in the string shown below, the 14 characters are indexed left to right
            from postion 0 to position 13.</p>
  <image source="Sequences/Figures/indexvalues.png" width="50%" alt="index values"/>
  <p>It is also the case that the positions are named from right to left using negative numbers where -1 is
            the rightmost index and so on. Note that the character at index 6 (or -8) is the blank character.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac5_3_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
school = "Luther College"
m = school[2]
print(m)

lastchar = school[-1]
print(lastchar)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The expression <c>school[2]</c> selects the character at index 2 from <c>school</c>, and creates a new
            string containing just this one character. The variable <c>m</c> refers to the result.</p>
  <p>The letter at index zero of <c>"Luther College"</c> is <c>L</c>.  So at
            position <c>[2]</c> we have the letter <c>t</c>.</p>
  <p>If you want the zero-eth letter of a string, you just put 0, or any expression
            with the value 0, in the brackets.  Give it a try.</p>
  <p>The expression in brackets is called an <term>index</term>. An index specifies a member
            of an ordered collection.  In this case the collection of characters in the string. The index
            <em>indicates</em> which character you want. It can be any integer
            expression so long as it evaluates to a valid index value.</p>
  <p>Note that indexing returns a <em>string</em> &#x2014; Python has no special type for a single character.
            It is just a string of length 1.</p>
  <subsection xml:id="sequences_index-operator-accessing-elements-of-a-list-or-tuple">
    <title>Index Operator: Accessing Elements of a List or Tuple</title>
    <p>The syntax for accessing the elements of a list or tuple is the same as the syntax for
                accessing the characters of a string.  We use the index operator ( <c>[]</c> &#x2013; not to
                be confused with an empty list). The expression inside the brackets specifies
                the index. Remember that the indices start at 0. Any integer expression can be used
                as an index and as with strings, negative index values will locate items from the right instead
                of from the left.</p>
    <p>When we say the first, third or nth character of a sequence, we generally mean counting the usual way, starting with 1.  The nth character and the character AT INDEX n are different then:  The nth character is at index n-1.  Make sure you are clear on what you mean!</p>
    <p>Try to predict what will be printed out by the following code, and then run it to check your
                prediction. (Actually, it's a good idea to always do that with the code examples. You
                will learn much more if you force yourself to make a prediction before you see the output.)</p>

    <note>
      <p>Why does counting start at 0 going from left to right, but at -1 going from right to left? Well, indexing starting at 0
                    has a long history in computer science having to do with some low-level implementation details that we won't
                    go into. For indexing from right to left, it might seem natural to do the analgous thing
                    and start at -0. Unfortunately, -0 is the same as 0, so s[-0] can't be the last item. Remember we
                    said that programming languages are formal languages where details matter and
                    everything is taken literally?</p>
