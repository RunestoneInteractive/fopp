        <title>Input</title>
        <!--video should go here, taken from steve's youtube video on print + input-->
        <p>Our programs get more interesting if they don't do exactly the same thing every time they run.
            One way to make them more interesting is to get <term>input</term> from the user.  Luckily, in Python
            there is a built-in function to accomplish this task.  It is called <c>input</c>.</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
n = input("Please enter your name: ")
</input></program>
        <p>The input function allows the programmer to provide a <term>prompt string</term>. In the example above,
            it is <q>Please enter your name: <q>.  When the function is evaluated, the prompt is
            shown (in the browser, look for a popup window).
            The user of the program can type some text and press <c>return</c>. When this
            happens the text that has been entered is returned from the <c>input</c> function,
            and in this case assigned to the variable <c>n</c>.  Run this example a few times and
            try some different names in the input box that appears.</p>

    <program xml:id="ac2_16_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
n = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hello", n)
        </input>
    </program>
        <p>It is very important to note that the <c>input</c> function returns a string value. Even if you
            asked the user to enter their age, you would get back a string like
            <c>"17"</c>.  It would be your job, as the programmer, to convert that string into
            an int or a float, using the <c>int</c> or <c>float</c> converter functions we saw
            earlier.</p>
        <note>
            <p>We often use the word <q>input</q> (or, synonymously, argument) to refer to the values that are passed to any function. Do not confuse that with the <c>input</c> function, which asks the user of a program to type in a value. Like any function, <c>input</c> itself takes an input argument and produces an output. The input is a character string that is displayed as a prompt to the user. The output is whatever character string the user types.</p>
            <p>This is analogous to the potential confusion of function <q>outputs</q> with the contents of the output window. Every function produces an output, which is a Python value. Only the print function puts things in the output window. Most functions take inputs, which are Python values. Only the input function invites users to type something.</p>
        </note>
        <p>Here is a program that turns a number of seconds into more human readable counts of hours,
            minutes, and seconds. A call to <c>input()</c> allows the user to enter the number of seconds.
            Then we convert that string to an integer.  From there we use the division and modulus
            operators to compute the results.</p>

    <program xml:id="ac2_16_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
str_seconds = input("Please enter the number of seconds you wish to convert")
total_secs = int(str_seconds)

hours = total_secs // 3600
secs_still_remaining = total_secs % 3600
minutes =  secs_still_remaining // 60
secs_finally_remaining = secs_still_remaining  % 60

print("Hrs=", hours, "mins=", minutes, "secs=", secs_finally_remaining)
        </input>
    </program>
        <p>The variable <c>str_seconds</c> will refer to the string that is entered by the user. As we said above, even though this string may be <c>7684</c>, it is still a string and not a number.  To convert it to an integer, we use the <c>int</c> function.
            The result is referred to by <c>total_secs</c>.  Now, each time you run the program, you can enter a new value for the number of seconds to be converted.</p>
