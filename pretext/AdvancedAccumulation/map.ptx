  <title>Map</title>
  <p>You previously were introduced to accumulating a list by transforming each of the elements. Here we revisit that pattern.</p>
  <p>The following function produces a new list with each item in the original list doubled. It is an example of a mapping,
            from the original list to a new list of the same length, where each element is doubled.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac21_2_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def doubleStuff(a_list):
    """ Return a new list in which contains doubles of the elements in a_list. """
    new_list = []
    for value in a_list:
        new_elem = 2 * value
        new_list.append(new_elem)
    return new_list

things = [2, 5, 9]
print(things)
things = doubleStuff(things)
print(things)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The doubleStuff function is an example of the accumulator pattern, in particular the mapping pattern. On line 3,
            <c>new_list</c> is initialized. On line 5, the doubled value for the current item is produced and on line 6 it is appended to
            the list we're accumulating. Line 7 executes after we've processed all the items in the original list: it returns the
            <c>new_list</c>. Once again, codelens helps us to see the actual references and objects as they are passed and returned.</p>
  <program xml:id="clens21_2_1" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
def doubleStuff(a_list):
    """ Return a new list in which contains doubles of the elements in a_list. """
    new_list = []
    for value in a_list:
        new_elem = 2 * value
        new_list.append(new_elem)
    return new_list

things = [2, 5, 9]
things = doubleStuff(things)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>This pattern of computation is so common that python offers a more general way to do mappings, the <c>map</c> function, that
            makes it more clear what the overall structure of the computation is. <c>map</c> takes two arguments, a function and a
            sequence. The function is the mapper that transforms items. It is automatically applied to each item in the sequence. You
            don't have to initialize an accumulator or iterate with a for loop at all.</p>
  <note>
    <p>Technically, in a proper Python 3 interpreter, the <c>map</c> function produces an <q>iterator</q>, which is like a list but
                produces the items as they are needed. Most places in Python where you can use a list (e.g., in a for loop) you can
                use an <q>iterator</q> as if it was actually a list. So you probably won't ever notice the difference. If you ever really
                need a list, you can explicitly turn the output of map into a list: <c>list(map(...))</c>. In the runestone environment, <c>map</c> actually returns a real list, but to make this code compatible with a full python environment, we always convert it to a list.</p>
  </note>
  <p>As we did when passing a function as a parameter to the <c>sorted</c> function, we can specify a function to pass to <c>map</c>
            either by referring to a function by name, or by providing a lambda expression.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac21_2_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def triple(value):
    return 3*value

def tripleStuff(a_list):
    new_seq = map(triple, a_list)
    return list(new_seq)

def quadrupleStuff(a_list):
    new_seq = map(lambda value: 4*value, a_list)
    return list(new_seq)

things = [2, 5, 9]
things3 = tripleStuff(things)
print(things3)
things4 = quadrupleStuff(things)
print(things4)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Of course, once we get used to using the <c>map</c> function, it's no longer necessary to define functions like
            <c>tripleStuff</c> and <c>quadrupleStuff</c>.</p>

things = [2, 5, 9]

things4 = map((lambda value: 4*value), things)
print(list(things4))

# or all on one line
print(list(map((lambda value: 5*value), [1, 2, 3])))
