  <title>Introduction: Map, Filter, List Comprehensions, and Zip</title>
  <p>Let's revisit the <xref ref="iteration_the-accumulator-pattern"/>. We have frequently taken a list and produced another list
            from it that contains either a subset of the items or a transformed version of each item. When each item is transformed we
            say that the operation is a <term>mapping, or just a map</term> of the original list. When some items are omitted, we call it a
            <term>filter</term>.</p>
  <p>Python provides built-in functions <c>map</c> and <c>filter</c>. Python also provides a new syntax, called
            <term>list comprehensions</term>, that lets you express a mapping and/or filtering operation. Just as with named functions and
            lambda expressions, some students seem to find it easier to think in terms of the map and filter functions, while other
            students find it easier to read and write list comprehensions. You'll learn both ways; one may even help you understand
            the other. Most python programmers use list comprehensions, so make sure you learn to read those. In this course, you can
            choose to learn to write list comprehensions or to use map and filter, whichever you prefer. You should learn to read both
            list comprehensions and map/filter.</p>
  <p>Other common accumulator patterns on lists aggregate all the values into a single value.</p>
  <p>Map, and filter are commands that you would use in high-performance computing on big datasets.
