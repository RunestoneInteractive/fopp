  <title>What is an exception?</title>
  <p>An <em>exception</em> is a signal that a condition has occurred that can't be easily
            handled using the normal flow-of-control of a Python program. <em>Exceptions</em>
            are often defined as being <q>errors</q> but this is not always the case. All
            errors in Python are dealt with using <em>exceptions</em>, but not all
            <em>exceptions</em> are errors.</p>
