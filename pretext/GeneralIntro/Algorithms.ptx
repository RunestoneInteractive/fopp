  <title>Algorithms</title>
  <p>If problem solving is a central part of computer science, then the solutions that you create through
            the problem solving process are also important.  In computer science, we refer to these solutions
            as <term>algorithms</term>.  An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.</p>
  <p>For example, an algorithm to compute the area of a circle given its radius might look like this:</p>
  <note>
    <title>Algorithm Example 1 (English)</title>
    <p>
      <ol label="1">
        <li>
          <p>Ask for radius</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Compute area by squaring radius and multiplying the result by pi</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Display the computed area</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </note>
  <p>Notice that this algorithm consists of a set of numbered steps. It is written in English, for ease of
            understanding. Although simple algorithms are easily understood when written in English, more complicated
            algorithms need more precise notation. For improved precision, algorithms are often written in pseudocode. <term>Pseudocode</term> is
            a notation that is more precise than English but generally not as precise as a programming language.
            The same algorithm expressed in pseudocode might look something like this:</p>

    <title>Algorithm Example 2 (Pseudocode)</title>
    <p>
      <ol label="1">
        <li>
          <p>Ask for radius</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>let area = (radius<superscript>2</superscript>) &#xD7; &#x3C0;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Display area</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </note>
  <p>Note how the pseudocode example expresses step 2 more precisely, specifying the formula in mathematical
            terms.</p>
  <p>Our goal in computer science is to take a problem and develop an algorithm that can serve as a general solution.
            Once we have such a solution, we can use our computer to automate its execution using programming.
            Programming is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in
            a notation (a program) that can be followed by a computer.  A program is written in a <term>programming language</term>
            such as Python, the language you will learn in this book.</p>
  <p>To help you understand the difference between an algorithm and a program, consider this program to compute
            the area of a circle:</p>
  <program xml:id="alg_impl" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
radius = int(input("Enter the radius:"))
area = (radius * radius) * 3.1415
print("The area of a circle with radius", radius, "is:", area)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>A <term>program</term> is an algorithm expressed in a programming language. We might also say
            that a program is an <em>implementation</em> of an algorithm. In this example, both the
            algorithm and the program have three steps. The first step gets some input from
            the user and the input into something the computer can do math with;
            the second step performs a calculation using the information obtained
            in the first step; and the final step displays the result to the user. Even
            though we haven't covered any details of Python, hopefully you can see the
            correspondence between the steps of the algorithm, which could be followed by a
            human (but not executed by a computer), and the steps of the program, which can
            be executed by a computer (try executing this one using the Run button).</p>
  <p>Algorithms are important because the process of solving a problem through programming often begins
            by designing an algorithm. The programmer often expresses the algorithm in
            pseudocode, then converts the algorithm to a program for the computer to execute.
            In the next section, you will learn how to execute Python programs on a computer.</p>

      <p>An algorithm is:</p>

        <statement>

        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>While it is true that algorithms often do solve problems, this is not the best answer.  An algorithm is more than just the solution to the problem for a computer.  An algorithm can be used to solve all sorts of problems, including those that have nothing to do with computers.</p>

          <p>Programmers sometimes use a special notation to illustrate or document an algorithm, but this is not the definition of an algorithm.</p>
