      <p>An intermediate language between source code and object code. Many
                            modern languages first compile source code into byte code and then
                            interpret the byte code with a program called a <em>virtual machine</em>.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>low-level language</title>

      <p>An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter, and the user of a
                            Python shell types commands at the prompt (&gt;&gt;&gt;), and presses the return
                            key to send these commands immediately to the interpreter for
                            processing. To initiate the Python Shell, the user should open theterminal and type <q>python</q>. Once the user presses           enter, the Python Shell appears and the user can interact with it.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>runtime error</title>
      <p>An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute
                            but that prevents the program from continuing.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>semantic error</title>

      <title>semantics</title>

      <title>shell mode</title>
      <p>A mode of using Python where expressions can be typed and executed in the command
                            prompt, and the results are shown immediately in the command terminal window. Shell mode is initiated by opening the           terminal of your operating system and typing <q>python</q>. Press enter and the Python Shell will appear. This is in               contrast to <term>source code</term>. Also see the entry under <term>Python shell</term>.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>source code</title>

      <p>The structure of a program.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>syntax error</title>
      <p>An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse &#x2014; and
                            therefore impossible to interpret.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>token</title>
