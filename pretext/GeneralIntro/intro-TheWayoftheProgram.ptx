  <title>Introduction: The Way of the Program</title>
  <video xml:id="goog_course_intro" youtube="xuEtNpVzFYA" width="500"/>
  <p>The goal of this book is to teach you to understand and create computer programs in Python.
            At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and objectives
            that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.</p>
  <p>Understanding computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking.
            Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed,
            they transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and
            very fast, but not creatively. Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you
            mean for them to do. Thus, understanding computer code
            involves a lot of mental simulation of what will actually happen, not what you
            wish would happen.</p>
  <p>Writing computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative
            problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think
            creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As
            it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to
            practice problem solving skills.</p>
