      <title>body</title>
      <p>The block of statements in a compound statement that follows the
                            header.</p>

      <title>boolean values</title>

      <title>branch</title>
      <p>One of the possible paths of the flow of execution determined by
                            conditional execution.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>chained conditional</title>
      <p>A conditional branch with more than two possible flows of execution. In
                            Python chained conditionals are written with <c>if ... elif ... else</c>
                            statements.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>comparison operator</title>
      <p>One of the operators that compares two values: <c>==</c>, <c>!=</c>, <c>&gt;</c>,
                            <c>&lt;</c>, <c>&gt;=</c>, and <c>&lt;=</c>.</p>

      <title>condition</title>
      <p>The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which
                            branch is executed.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>conditional statement</title>
      <p>A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some
                            condition. In Python the keywords <c>if</c>, <c>elif</c>, and <c>else</c> are
                            used for conditional statements.</p>

      <title>logical operators</title>
      <p><q>and</q>, <q>or</q> and <q>not</q> are logical operators used to evaluate expressions. Their semantic meaning is similar to their English meaning.</p>
    </gi>

      <title>nesting</title>
      <p>One program structure within another, such as a conditional statement
                            inside a branch of another conditional statement.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>unary selection</title>
      <p>A selection statement in which there is only an <q>if</q> statement and the <q>else</q> statement is omitted entirely. In an unary selection, the statements are only executed if the condition evaluates to true, otherwise the program continues to the body following the if statement.</p>
