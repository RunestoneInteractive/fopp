  <title>&#x1F469;&#x200D;&#x1F4BB; Setting Up Conditionals</title>
  <p>Before writing your conditionals, it can be helpful to make your own flowchart that will
            plot out the flow of each condition. By writing out the flow, you can better determine how
            complex the set of conditionals will be as well as check to see if any condition is not
            taken care of before you begin writing it out.</p>
  <p>To make sure that your code covers all of the conditions that you intend for it to cover, you
            should add comments for each clause that explains what that clause is meant to do. Then, you
            should add tests for each possible path that the program could go though. What leads
            to certain conditional statements being executed? Is that what you intended?</p>

    <title>Choosing your type of Conditional</title>
    <p>When adding conditionals to your program, you should also consider the kinds of conditionals
                that are at your disposal and what would fit best.</p>
    <image source="Conditionals/Figures/valid_conditionals.png" width="50%"/>
    <p>Though you'll use them often, remember that conditional statements don't always need an else clause.
                When deciding the flow, ask yourself what you want to have happen under a certain condition.
                For example, if you wanted to find all of the words that have the letter &#x2018;n' in them. If there's nothing
                that needs to happen when a word does not contain the letter &#x2018;n' then you won't need an else
                clause. The program should just continue onward!</p>
    <exercise label="question7_11_1">
      <statement>
        <p>What is the best set of conditonal statements provided based on the following prompt? You want to keep track of all the words that have the letter &#x2018;t' and in a separate variable you want to keep track of all the words that have the letter &#x2018;z' in them.</p>

          <feedback>
            <p>Using if/else either uses an unnecessary else statement or would improperly keep track of one of the accumulator variables.</p>

          </statement>
          <feedback>
            <p>Using if/elif means that words that have both a "t" and a "z" would not be propperly counted by the two variables.</p>

            <p>Yes, two if statements will keep track of - and properly update - the two different accumulator variables.</p>

          <feedback>
            <p>Using if/elif/else here will provide an unnecessary else statement and improperly update one of the accumulator variables in the case where a word has both a "t" and a "z".</p>
