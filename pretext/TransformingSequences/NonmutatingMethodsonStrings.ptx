  <title>Non-mutating Methods on Strings</title>
  <p>There are a wide variety of methods for string objects.
            Try the following program.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac8_8_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
ss = "Hello, World"
print(ss.upper())

tt = ss.lower()
print(tt)
print(ss)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In this example, <c>upper</c> is a method that can be invoked on any string object to create a new string
            in which all the characters are in uppercase. <c>lower</c> works in a similar fashion changing all
            characters in the string to lowercase. (The original string <c>ss</c> remains unchanged.  A new string
            <c>tt</c> is created.)</p>
  <p xml:id="transforming-sequences_string-methods" names="string_methods">You've already seen a few methods, such as <c>count</c> and <c>index</c>, that work with strings and are
            non-mutating. In addition to those and <c>upper</c> and <c>lower</c>, the following table provides a summary
            of some other useful string methods. There are a few activecode examples that follow so that you can
            try them out.</p>

    <title>String Format Method</title>
    <p>Until now, we have created strings with variable content using the + operator to concatenate
                partial strings together. That works, but it's very hard for people to read or debug a code
                line that includes variable names and strings and complex expressions. Consider the following:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac8_8_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
name = "Rodney Dangerfield"
score = -1  # No respect!
print("Hello " + name + ". Your score is " + str(score))
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>Or perhaps more realistically:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac8_8_5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
scores = [("Rodney Dangerfield", -1), ("Marlon Brando", 1), ("You", 100)]
for person in scores:
    name = person[0]
    score = person[1]
    print("Hello " + name + ". Your score is " + str(score))
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>In this section, you will learn to write that in a more readable way:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac8_8_6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
scores = [("Rodney Dangerfield", -1), ("Marlon Brando", 1), ("You", 100)]
for person in scores:
    name = person[0]
    score = person[1]
    print("Hello {}. Your score is {}.".format(name, score))
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>In grade school quizzes a common convention is to use fill-in-the blanks. For instance,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hello _____!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and you can fill in the name of the person greeted, and combine given text with a chosen
                insertion. <em>We use this as an analogy:</em> Python has a similar construction, better called
                fill-in-the-braces. The string method <c>format</c>, makes substitutions into places in a string
                enclosed in braces. Run this code:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac8_8_7" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
person = input('Your name: ')
greeting = 'Hello {}!'.format(person)
print(greeting)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>There are several new ideas here!</p>
    <p>The string for the <c>format</c> method has a special form, with braces embedded.
                Such a string is called a <em>format string</em>.  Places where
                braces are embedded are replaced by the value of an expression
                taken from the parameter list for the <c>format</c> method. There are many
                variations on the syntax between the braces. In this case we use
                the syntax where the first (and only) location in the string with
                braces has a substitution made from the first (and only) parameter.</p>
    <p>In the code above, this new string is assigned to the identifier
                <c>greeting</c>, and then the string is printed.</p>
    <p>The identifier <c>greeting</c> was introduced to break the operations into a clearer sequence of
                steps. However, since the value of <c>greeting</c> is only referenced once, it can be eliminated
                with the more concise version:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac8_8_8" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
person = input('Enter your name: ')
print('Hello {}!'.format(person))
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>There can be multiple substitutions, with data of any type.
                Next we use floats.  Try original price $2.50  with a 7% discount:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac8_8_9" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
calculation = '${} discounted by {}% is ${}.'.format(origPrice, discount, newPrice)
print(calculation)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>It is important to pass arguments to the <c>format</c> method in the correct order, because they
                are matched <em>positionally</em> into the <c>{}</c> places for interpolation where there is more than
                one.</p>
    <p>If you used the data suggested, this result is not satisfying.
                Prices should appear with exactly two places beyond the decimal point,
                but that is not the default way to display floats.</p>
    <p>Format strings can give further information inside the braces
                showing how to specially format data.
                In particular floats can be shown with a specific number of decimal places.
                For two decimal places, put <c>:.2f</c> inside the braces for the monetary values:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac8_8_10" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
calculation = '${:.2f} discounted by {}% is ${:.2f}.'.format(origPrice, discount, newPrice)
print(calculation)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>The 2 in the format modifier can be replaced by another integer to round to that
                specified number of digits.</p>
    <p>This kind of format string depends directly on the order of the
                parameters to the format method. There are other approaches that we will
                skip here, such as explicitly numbering substitutions.</p>
    <p>It is also important that you give <c>format</c> the same amount of arguments as there are <c>{}</c> waiting for interpolation in the string. If you have a <c>{}</c> in a string that you do not pass arguments for, you may not get an error, but you will see a weird <c>undefined</c> value you probably did not intend suddenly inserted into your string. You can see an example below.</p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <program xml:id="ac8_8_11" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
name = "Sally"
greeting = "Nice to meet you"
s = "Hello, {}. {}."

print(s.format(name,greeting)) # will print Hello, Sally. Nice to meet you.

print(s.format(greeting,name)) # will print Hello, Nice to meet you. Sally.

print(s.format(name)) # 2 {}s, only one interpolation item! Not ideal.
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>A technical point: Since braces have special meaning in a format string, there must be a
                special rule if you want braces to actually be included in the final <em>formatted</em> string. The
                rule is to double the braces: <c>{&#x200B;{</c> and <c>}&#x200B;}</c>. For example mathematical set notation uses
                braces. The initial and final doubled braces in the format string below generate literal
                braces in the formatted string:</p>
    <pre>a = 5
b = 9
setStr = 'The set is {&#x200B;{&#x200B;{}, {}&#x200B;}&#x200B;}.'.format(a, b)
print(setStr)</pre>
    <p>Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the ActiveCode format implementation has a bug,
                printing doubled braces, but standard Python prints <c>{5, 9}</c>.</p>
