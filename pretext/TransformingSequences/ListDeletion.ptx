  <title>List Element Deletion</title>
  <p>Using slices to delete list elements can be awkward and therefore error-prone.
            Python provides an alternative that is more readable.
            The <c>del</c> statement removes an element from a list by using its position.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac8_2_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
a = ['one', 'two', 'three']
del a[1]
print(a)

alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
del alist[1:5]
print(alist)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>As you might expect, <c>del</c> handles negative indices and causes a runtime
            error if the index is out of range. In addition, you can use a slice as an index for <c>del</c>.
            As usual, slices select all the elements up to, but not including, the second index.</p>
