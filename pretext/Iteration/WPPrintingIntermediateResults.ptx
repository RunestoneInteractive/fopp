  <p>In this textbook we provide the codelens tool so that you are able to step through
            the program and watch what happens each time a line is evaluated by the Python
            interpretor. What if you didn't have codelens though, what would you do?</p>
  <p>In that case, print statements are your best friend. They can show you what the value of
            something is. This is especially helpful in the case of writing for loops or accumulating
            a value. If something is going wrong you can compare what you expect to happen to what
            is actually happening.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac6_7_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
w = range(10)

tot = 0
for num in w:
    tot += num
print(tot)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Say we weren't sure what <c>num</c> was being assigned each time we iterated. One way to find out
            would be to add a print statement inside of the for loop to see.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac6_7_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
w = range(10)

tot = 0
for num in w:
    print(num)
    tot += num
print(tot)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>If we wanted to see what was happening to <c>tot</c> as well, we could print that out in the for loop as well!</p>
  <program xml:id="ac6_7_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
w = range(10)


tot = 0
for num in w:
    print(num)
    tot += num
    print(tot)
print(tot)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Finally, if we wanted to make these numbers easier to understand, we could add more to the print statements
            to make them easier to read!</p>
  <program xml:id="ac6_7_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
w = range(10)

tot = 0
print("***** Before the For Loop ******")
for num in w:
    print("***** A New Loop Iteration ******")
    print("Value of num:", num)
    tot += num
    print("Value of tot:", tot)
print("***** End of For Loop *****")
print("Final total:", tot)
        </input>
  </program>
