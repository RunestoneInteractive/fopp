  <title>The Accumulator Pattern</title>
  <p>One common programming <q>pattern</q> is to traverse a sequence, <term>accumulating</term> a value as we go,
            such as the sum-so-far or the maximum-so-far. That way, at the end of the traversal we have
            accumulated a single value, such as the sum total of all the items or the largest item.</p>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>The anatomy of the accumulation pattern includes:</title>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><term>initializing</term> an <q>accumulator</q> variable to an initial value (such as 0 if accumulating a sum)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><term>iterating</term> (e.g., traversing the items in a sequence)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><term>updating</term> the accumulator variable on each iteration (i.e., when processing each item in the sequence)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
  </dl>
  <p>For example, consider the following code, which computes the sum of the numbers in a list.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac6_6_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
accum = 0
for w in nums:
    accum = accum + w
print(accum)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In the program above, notice that the variable <c>accum</c> starts out with a value of 0.
            Next, the iteration is performed 10 times.  Inside the for loop, the update occurs.
            <c>w</c> has the value of current item (1 the first time, then 2, then 3, etc.).
            <c>accum</c> is reassigned a new value which is the old value plus the current value of <c>w</c>.</p>
  <p>This pattern of iterating the updating of a variable is commonly referred to as the
            <term>accumulator pattern</term>. We refer to the variable as the <term>accumulator</term>. This pattern will come up
            over and over again. Remember that the key to making it work successfully is to be sure to
            initialize the variable before you start the iteration. Once inside the iteration, it is required
            that you update the accumulator.</p>
  <p>Here is the same program in codelens.  Step through the function and watch the <q>running total</q>
            accumulate the result.</p>
  <program xml:id="clens6_6_1" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
accum = 0
for w in nums:
   accum = accum + w
print(accum)
    </input>
  </program>
  <note>
    <p>What would happen if we indented the print accum statement? Not sure? Make a prediction, then try it and find out.</p>
  </note>
  <p>We can utilize the range function in this situation as well. Previously, you've seen it used when we wanted to draw in
            turtle. There we used it to iterate a certain number of times. We can do more than that though. The <c>range</c> function
            takes at least one input - which should be an integer - and returns a list as long as your input. While you can provide
            two inputs, we will focus on using range with just one input. With one input, range will start at zero and go up to - but
            not include - the input. Here are the examples:</p>
  <program xml:id="ac6_8_10" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print("range(5): ")
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

print("range(0,5): ")
for i in range(0, 5):
    print(i)

# Notice the casting of `range` to the `list`
print(list(range(5)))
print(list(range(0,5)))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Here's how you could use the range function in the previous problem.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac6_6_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
accum = 0
for w in range(11):
    accum = accum + w
print(accum)

# or, if you use two inputs for the range function

sec_accum = 0
for w in range(1,11):
    sec_accum = sec_accum + w
print(sec_accum)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Because the range function is exclusive of the ending number, we have to use 11 as the function input.</p>
  <p>We can use the accumulation pattern to count the number of things or to sum up a total. The
            above examples only covered how to get the sum for a list, but we can also count how many items are
            in the list if we wanted to.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac6_6_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
count = 0
for w in nums:
    count = count + 1
print(count)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In this example we don't make use of <c>w</c> even though the iterator variable (loop variable) is a necessary part of
            constructing a for loop. Instead of adding the value of <c>w</c> to <c>count</c> we add a 1 to it,
            because we're incrementing the value of count when we iterate each time through the loop. Though in
            this scenario we could have used the <c>len</c> function, there are other cases later on where len
            won't be useful but we will still need to count.</p>
