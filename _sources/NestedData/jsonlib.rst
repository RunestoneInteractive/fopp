Processing JSON results
=======================

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It looks a lot like the representation of nested dictionaries and lists in 
python when we write them out as literals in a program, but with a few small differences (e.g., the word null instead of 
None). When your program receives a JSON-formatted string, generally you will want to convert it into a python object, a 
list or a dictionary.

Again, python provides a module for doing this. The module is called json. We will be using two functions in this module, 
``loads`` and ``dumps``.

``json.loads()`` takes a string as input and produces a python object (a dictionary or a list) as output.

Consider, for example, some data that we might get from Apple's iTunes, in the JSON format:

.. activecode:: ac17_3_1
    :language: python

    import json
    a_string = '\n\n\n{\n "resultCount":25,\n "results": [\n{"wrapperType":"track", "kind":"podcast", "collectionId":10892}]}'
    print(a_string)
    d = json.loads(a_string)
    print("------")
    print(type(d))
    print(d.keys())
    print(d['resultCount'])
    # print(a_string['resultCount'])

The other function we will use is ``dumps``. It does the inverse of ``loads``. It takes a python object, typically a dictionary or a list, and returns a string, in JSON format. It has a few other parameters. Two useful parameters are sort_keys and indent. When the value True is passed for the sort_keys parameter, the keys of dictionaries are output in alphabetic order with their values. The indent parameter expects an integer. When it is provided, dumps generates a string suitable for displaying to people, with newlines and indentation for nested lists or dictionaries. For example, the following function uses json.dumps to make a human-readable printout of a nested data structure.

.. activecode:: ac17_3_2
    :language: python

    import json
    def pretty(obj):
        return json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=2)

    d = {'key1': {'c': True, 'a': 90, 5: 50}, 'key2':{'b': 3, 'c': "yes"}}

    print(d)
    print('--------')
    print(pretty(d))

**Check Your Understanding**

.. mchoice:: question17_3_1
   :answer_a: json.loads(d)
   :answer_b: json.dumps(d)
   :answer_c: d.json()
   :feedback_a: loads turns a json-formatted string into a list or dictionary
   :feedback_b: dumps turns a list or dictionary into a json-formatted string
   :feedback_c: .json() tries to invoke the json method, but that method is not defined for dictionaries
   :correct: b
   :practice: T

   Because we can only write strings into a file, if we wanted to convert a dictionary `d` into a json-formatted string so that we could store it in a file, what would we use?

.. mchoice:: question17_3_2
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: entertainment.json()
   :answer_b: json.dumps(entertainment)
   :answer_c: json.loads(entertainment)
   :feedback_a: The .json() method is not defined for strings.
   :feedback_b: dumps (dump to string) turns a list or dictionary into a json-formatted string
   :feedback_c: loads (load from string) turns a json-formatted string into a list or dictionary
   :correct: c
   :practice: T

   Say we had a JSON string in the following format. How would you convert it so that it is a python list?

   .. sourcecode:: python

       entertainment = """[{"Library Data": {"count": 3500, "rows": 10, "locations": 3}}, {"Movie Theater Data": {"count": 8, "rows": 25, "locations": 2}}]"""
