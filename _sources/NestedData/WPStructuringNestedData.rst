üë©‚Äçüíª Structuring Nested Data
-----------------------------

When constructing your own nested data, it is a good idea to keep the structure consistent across each level. For example,
if you have a list of dictionaries, then each dictionary should have the same structure. Meaning the same keys and the same type of value associated with a particular key in all the dictionaries. The reason
for this is because any deviation in the structure that is used will require extra code to handle those special cases. The
more the structure deviates, the more you will have to use special cases.
