        The Curse of the Baskervilles</h3>

    <p>"I have in my pocket a manuscript," said Dr. James Mortimer.</p>

    <p>"I observed it as you entered the room," said Holmes.</p>

    <p>"It is an old manuscript."</p>

    <p>"Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery."</p>

    <p>"How can you say that, sir?"</p>

    <p>"You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all
        the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert
        who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.
        You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.
        I put that at 1730."</p>

    <p>"The exact date is 1742." Dr. Mortimer drew it from his
        breast-pocket. "This family paper was committed to my care by Sir
        Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three
        months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say
        that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.
        He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as
        unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very
        seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did
        eventually overtake him."</p>

    <p>Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it
        upon his knee.</p>

    <p>"You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and
        the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to
        fix the date."</p>

    <p>I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded
        script. At the head was written: "Baskerville Hall," and below in
        large, scrawling figures: "1742."</p>

    <p>"It appears to be a statement of some sort."</p>

    <p>"Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the
        Baskerville family."</p>

    <p>"But I understand that it is something more modern and practical
        upon which you wish to consult me?"</p>

    <p>"Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be
        decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and
        is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I
        will read it to you."</p>

    <p>Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,
        and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer
        turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking
        voice the following curious, old-world narrative:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been
        many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo
        Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also had
        it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it occurred
        even as is here set forth. And I would have you believe, my sons,
        that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously
        forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and
        repentance it may be removed. Learn then from this story not to
        fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the
        future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered
        so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.</p>

    <p>"Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the history
        of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend
        to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of
        that name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild,
        profane, and godless man. This, in truth, his neighbours might
        have pardoned, seeing that saints have never flourished in those
        parts, but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour
        which made his name a byword through the West. It chanced that
        this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be
        known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held
        lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden, being
        discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for she
        feared his evil name. So it came to pass that one Michaelmas
        this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions,
        stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father
        and brothers being from home, as he well knew. When they had
        brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper
        chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse,
        as was their nightly custom. Now, the poor lass upstairs was like
        to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible
        oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the
        words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were such as
        might blast the man who said them. At last in the stress of her
        fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most
        active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered
        (and still covers) the south wall she came down from under the
        eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three leagues
        betwixt the Hall and her father's farm.</p>

    <p>"It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to
        carry food and drink&mdash;with other worse things, perchance&mdash;to his
        captive, and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped. Then,
        as it would seem, he became as one that hath a devil, for,
        rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the
        great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he
        cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night
        render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but
        overtake the wench. And while the revellers stood aghast at the
        fury of the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than
        the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her.
        Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms that they
        should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the
        hounds a kerchief of the maid's, he swung them to the line, and
        so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.</p>

    <p>"Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to
        understand all that had been done in such haste. But anon their
        bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be
        done upon the moorlands. Everything was now in an uproar, some
        calling for their pistols, some for their horses, and some for
        another flask of wine. But at length some sense came back to
        their crazed minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number,
        took horse and started in pursuit. The moon shone clear above
        them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course which the
        maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.</p>

    <p>"They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night
        shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he
        had seen the hunt. And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed
        with fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he
        had indeed seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her
        track. 'But I have seen more than that,' said he, 'for Hugo
        Baskerville passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute
        behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at
        my heels.' So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode
        onward. But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a
        galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with white
        froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle. Then the
        revellers rode close together, for a great fear was on them, but
        they still followed over the moor, though each, had he been
        alone, would have been right glad to have turned his horse's
        head. Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the
        hounds. These, though known for their valour and their breed,
        were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,
        as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with
        starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley
        before them.</p>

    <p>"The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may
        guess, than when they started. The most of them would by no means
        advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may be the most
        drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it opened into a broad
        space in which stood two of those great stones, still to be seen
        there, which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of
        old. The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there in
        the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of
        fear and of fatigue. But it was not the sight of her body, nor
        yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,
        which raised the hair upon the heads of these three daredevil
        roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at
        his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast,
        shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal
        eye has rested upon. And even as they looked the thing tore the
        throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its
        blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with
        fear and rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.
        One, it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and
        the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days.</p>

    <p>"Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is
        said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since. If I have
        set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less
        terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed. Nor can it
        be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their
        deaths, which have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious. Yet may
        we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence,
        which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or
        fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ. To that
        Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by
        way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark
        hours when the powers of evil are exalted.</p>

    <p>"[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John, with
        instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister
        Elizabeth.]"</p>

    <p>When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he
        pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.
        Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his
        cigarette into the fire.</p>

    <p>"Well?" said he.</p>

    <p>"Do you not find it interesting?"</p>

    <p>"To a collector of fairy tales."</p>

    <p>Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.</p>

    <p>"Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more
        recent. This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this
        year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of
        Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that
        date."</p>

    <p>My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became
        intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name
        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for
        Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the county.
        Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a
        comparatively short period his amiability of character and
        extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who
        had been brought into contact with him. In these days of <i>nouveaux
            riches</i> it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old
        county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his
        own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen
        grandeur of his line. Sir Charles, as is well known, made large
        sums of money in South African speculation. More wise than those
        who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realized his
        gains and returned to England with them. It is only two years
        since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is
        common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and
        improvement which have been interrupted by his death. Being
        himself childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the
        whole country-side should, within his own lifetime, profit by his
        good fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing
        his untimely end. His generous donations to local and county
        charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns.</p>

    <p>"The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
        cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest,
        but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to
        which local superstition has given rise. There is no reason
        whatever to suspect foul play, or to imagine that death could be
        from any but natural causes. Sir Charles was a widower, and a man
        who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit
        of mind. In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his
        personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville Hall
        consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the husband acting
        as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their evidence,
        corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show that Sir
        Charles's health has for some time been impaired, and points
        especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in
        changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous
        depression. Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant
        of the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.</p>

    <p>"The facts of the case are simple. Sir Charles Baskerville was in
        the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the
        famous Yew Alley of Baskerville Hall. The evidence of the
        Barrymores shows that this had been his custom. On the 4th of May
        Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for
        London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That
        night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course
        of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never
        returned. At twelve o'clock Barrymore, finding the hall door
        still open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in
        search of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's
        footmarks were easily traced down the Alley. Half-way down this
        walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. There were
        indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here.
        He then proceeded down the Alley, and it was at the far end of it
        that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been
        explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master's
        footprints altered their character from the time that he passed
        the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have
        been walking upon his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was
        on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by
        his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares
        that he heard cries, but is unable to state from what
        direction they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered
        upon Sir Charles's person, and though the doctor's evidence
        pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion&mdash;so great that
        Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his
        friend and patient who lay before him&mdash;it was explained that that
        is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death
        from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by the
        post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic
        disease, and the coroner's jury returned a verdict in accordance
        with the medical evidence. It is well that this is so, for it is
        obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles's heir should
        settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so
        sadly interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not
        finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been
        whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been
        difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. It is understood
        that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still
        alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's younger brother. The
        young man when last heard of was in America, and inquiries are
        being instituted with a view to informing him of his good
        fortune."</p>

    <p>Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.</p>

    <p>"Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the
        death of Sir Charles Baskerville."</p>

    <p>"I must thank you," said Sherlock Holmes, "for calling my
        attention to a case which certainly presents some features of
        interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but
        I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the
        Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch
        with several interesting English cases. This article, you say,
        contains all the public facts?"</p>

    <p>"It does."</p>

    <p>"Then let me have the private ones." He leaned back, put his
        finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial
        expression.</p>

    <p>"In doing so," said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of
        some strong emotion, "I am telling that which I have not confided
        to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner's
        inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in
        the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition.
        I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper
        says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to
        increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these
        reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less
        than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but
        with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.</p>

    <p>"The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near
        each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a
        good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr.
        Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,
        there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir
        Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought
        us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so.
        He had brought back much scientific information from South
        Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
        discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the
        Hottentot.</p>

    <p>"Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me
        that Sir Charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking
        point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly
        to heart&mdash;so much so that, although he would walk in his own
        grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at
        night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was
        honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and
        certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors
        were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence
        constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has
        asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen
        any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter
        question he put to me several times, and always with a voice
        which vibrated with excitement.</p>

    <p>"I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some
        three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall
        door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of
        him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder, and
        stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I
        whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something
        which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the
        drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go
        down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for
        it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the
        worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the
        evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion
        which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative
        which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small
        episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy
        which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter
        was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no
        justification.</p>

    <p>"It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London.
        His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in
        which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was
        evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that
        a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a
        new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at
        his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant
        came this terrible catastrophe.</p>

    <p>"On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who
        made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me,
        and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall
        within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the
        facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the
        footsteps down the Yew Alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate
        where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the
        shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no
        other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and
        finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched
        until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his
        fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some
        strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn
        to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any
        kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the
        inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round
        the body. He did not observe any. But I did&mdash;some little distance
        off, but fresh and clear."</p>

    <p>"Footprints?"</p>

    <p>"Footprints."</p>

    <p>"A man's or a woman's?"</p>

    <p>Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice
        sank almost to a whisper as he answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!"</p>
