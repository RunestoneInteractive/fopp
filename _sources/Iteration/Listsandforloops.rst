Lists and ``for`` loops
=======================

It is also possible to perform **list traversal** using iteration by item. A list is a sequence of items, so the ``for`` loop iterates over each item in the list automatically. 

.. activecode:: ac6_5_1

    fruits = ["apple","orange","banana","cherry"]

    for afruit in fruits:     # by item
        print(afruit)

It almost reads like natural language: For (every) fruit in (the list of) fruits,
print (the name of the) fruit.

Remember the turtle drawings we made earlier? For loops and lists can be applied there as well!

Iteration Simplifies our Turtle Program
---------------------------------------

To draw a square we'd like to do the same thing four times --- move the turtle forward some 
distance and turn 90 degrees.  We previously used 8 lines of Python code to have alex draw the four 
sides of a square.  This next program does exactly the same thing but, with the help of the for 
statement, uses just three lines (not including the setup code).  Remember that the for statement 
will repeat the `forward` and `left` four times, one time for each value in the list.

.. activecode:: ac6_5_2
   :nocodelens:

   import turtle            # set up alex
   wn = turtle.Screen()
   alex = turtle.Turtle()

   for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:      # repeat four times
       alex.forward(50)
       alex.left(90)

   wn.exitonclick()



While "saving some lines of code" might be convenient, it is not the big
deal here.  What is much more important is that we've found a "repeating
pattern" of statements, and we reorganized our program to repeat the pattern.

The values [0,1,2,3] were provided to make the loop body execute 4 times.
We could have used any four values.  For example, consider the following program.


.. activecode:: ac6_5_3
   :nocodelens:

   import turtle            # set up alex
   wn = turtle.Screen()
   alex = turtle.Turtle()

   for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:      # repeat four times
       alex.forward(50)
       alex.left(90)

   wn.exitonclick()

In the previous example, there were four integers in the list.  This time there are four strings. 
Since there are four items in the list, the iteration will still occur four times.  ``aColor`` will 
take on each color in the list.  We can even take this one step further and use the value of 
``aColor`` as part of the computation.

.. activecode:: ac6_5_4
    :nocodelens:

    import turtle            # set up alex
    wn = turtle.Screen()
    alex = turtle.Turtle()

    for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
        alex.color(aColor)
        alex.forward(50)
        alex.left(90)

    wn.exitonclick()

In this case, the value of ``aColor`` is used to change the color attribute of ``alex``. Each 
iteration causes ``aColor`` to change to the next value in the list.

The for-loop is our first example of a **compound statement**. Syntactically a compound statement 
is a statement. The level of indentation of a (whole) compound statement is the indentation of its 
heading. In the example above there are five statements with the same indentation, executed 
sequentially: the import, 2 assignments, the *whole* for-loop, and ``wn.exitonclick()``. The 
for-loop compound statement is executed completely before going on to the next sequential 
statement, ``wn.exitonclick()``.

**Check your Understanding**

.. mchoice:: question6_5_1
   :answer_a: 8
   :answer_b: 9
   :answer_c: 15
   :answer_d: Error, the for statement needs to use the range function.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Iteration by item will process once for each item in the sequence, even the empty list.
   :feedback_b: Yes, there are nine elements in the list so the for loop will iterate nine times.
   :feedback_c: Iteration by item will process once for each item in the sequence. Each string is viewed as a single item, even if you are able to iterate over a string itself.
   :feedback_d: The for statement can iterate over a sequence item by item.

   How many times will the for loop iterate in the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

      p = [3, 4, "Me", 3, [], "Why", 0, "Tell", 9.3]
      for ch in p:
         print(ch)

.. mchoice:: question6_5_2
   :answer_a: They are indented to the same degree from the loop header.
   :answer_b: There is always exactly one line in the loop body.
   :answer_c: The loop body ends with a semi-colon (;) which is not shown in the code above.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The loop body can have any number of lines, all indented from the loop header.
   :feedback_b: The loop body may have more than one line.
   :feedback_c: Python does not need semi-colons in its syntax, but relies mainly on indentation.

   How does python know what statements are contained in the loop body?

.. mchoice:: question6_5_3
      :answer_a: Draw a square using the same color for each side.
      :answer_b: Draw a square using a different color for each side.
      :answer_c: Draw one side of a square.
      :correct: c
      :feedback_a: The question is not asking you to describe the outcome of the entire loop, the question is asking you about the outcome of a **single iteration** of the loop.
      :feedback_b: Notice that aColor is never actually used inside the loop.
      :feedback_c: The body of the loop only draws one side of the square.  It will be repeated once for each item in the list.  However, the color of the turtle never changes.

      Consider the following code:

      .. code-block:: python

        for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "green", "blue"]:
           alex.forward(50)
           alex.left(90)

      What does each iteration through the loop do?
