    Write one for loop to print out each character of the string ``my_str`` on a separate line.
    ~~~~
    my_str = "MICHIGAN"

    =====

    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def test_output(self):
        self.assertIn('for', self.getEditorText(), "Testing your code (Don't worry about actual and expected values).")
        self.assertIn("M\nI\nC\nH\nI\nG\nA\nN", self.getOutput(), "Testing output (Don't worry about actual and expected values).")

.. activecode:: assess_ps_02_02
    :language: python
    :autograde: unittest
    :practice: T
    :topics: Iteration/Listsandforloops

    Write one for loop to print out each element of the list ``several_things``. Then, write *another* for loop to print out the TYPE of each element of the list ``several_things``. To complete this problem you should have written two different for loops, each of which iterates over the list ``several_things``, but each of those 2 for loops should have a different result.
    ~~~~
    several_things = ["hello", 2, 4, 6.0, 7.5, 234352354, "the end", "", 99]

    Write code that uses iteration to print out **the length** of each element of the list stored in ``str_list``.

    # Write your code here.

.. activecode:: assess_ps_02_04
    :language: python
    :autograde: unittest

    Write a program that uses the turtle module **and** a for loop to draw something. It doesn't have to be complicated, but draw something different than we have done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting ``.speed(10)`` for the turtle to draw fast, or ``.speed(0)`` for it to draw super fast with no animation.)
    ~~~~
    import turtle




.. activecode:: assess_ps_02_05
    :language: python
    :autograde: unittest
    :practice: T
    :topics: Iteration/TheAccumulatorPattern

    Write code to count the number of characters in ``original_str`` using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable ``num_chars``. Do NOT use the ``len`` function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on this problem, comment it out afterward!)
    ~~~~
    original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."


    =====

    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
           self.assertEqual(num_chars, len(original_str), "Testing whether num_chars_sent has the correct value")
           self.assertNotIn('len', self.getEditorText(), "Testing that you are not including the len function in your code. (Don't worry about Actual and Expected Values.)")

    :topics: Iteration/TraversalandtheforLoopByIndex

    ``addition_str`` is a string with a list of numbers separated by the ``+`` sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to take the sum of all of the numbers and assigns it to ``sum_val`` (an integer). (You should use the ``.split("+")`` function to split by ``"+"`` and ``int()`` to cast to an integer).

    ~~~~
    addition_str = "2+5+10+20"


    =====

    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):

    :topics: Iteration/TraversalandtheforLoopByIndex

    ``week_temps_f`` is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the ``,`` sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the **average** (sum divided by number of items) and assigns it to ``avg_temp``. Do not hard code your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or the number of items in ``week_temps_f``) (You should use the ``.split(",")`` function to split by ``","`` and ``float()`` to cast to a float).

    ~~~~
    week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"

   Write code to create a list of numbers from 0 to 67 and assign that list to the variable ``nums``. Do not hard code the list.
