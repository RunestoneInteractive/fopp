ðŸ¤” Computing Statistics with Kiva Data
========================================

`Kiva <http://kiva.org>`_ is an international nonprofit, founded in 2005 and based in San Francisco, with a mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty. We celebrate and support people looking to create a better future for themselves, their families and their communities.  By lending as little as $25 on Kiva, anyone can help a borrower start or grow a business, go to school, access clean energy or realize their potential. For some, itâ€™s a matter of survival, for others itâ€™s the fuel for a life-long ambition.  The following table contains some data that we will use to practice on some basic descriptive statistics that are commonly used in data science.

.. csv-table:: Kiva Lending Data
    :file: kiva_smallest.csv
    :header-rows: 1



There are some great (more advanced) tools in Python for working with massive tables of data.  In fact this table is a random sample of a data set from Kiva that contains 1.4 million rows!  We will move on to more and bigger data sets in time, but for now we need a simple way to work with this sample.  To do that we will represent each column of the table as its own list.

To keep your coding easier and cleaner we will show you these lists here, but they will be automatically included for you in later activecodes.  You can just use the list by name and it will be fine.

#. In which country was the loan granted that took the longest to fund?
#. What is the average amount of time / dollar it takes to fund a loan?
#. What is the standard deviation of the money loaned?   The Empirical Rule or 68-95-99.7% Rule reminds us that 68% of the population falls within 1 standard  deviation.  Does this hold for our data?

For our final few exercises we are interested in exploring the distribution of the data as well as the relationships between two of our variables.  To do this we need to introduce a few more statistical concepts including variance, standard deviation, covariance and correlation.

**Variance** looks at a single variable and measures how far the set of numbers are spread out from their average value.  However its a bit hard to interpret because the units are squared so its not on the same scale as our original numbers.  This is why most of the time we use the **standard devation**, which is just the square root of the variance.  A large standard deviation tells us that our data is quite spread out while a small standard deviation tells us that most of our data is pretty close to the mean. 

.. math::

    variance = \frac{\sum{ (x-\bar{x})^2}}{n}

.. math::

    stdev = \sqrt{variance}

Don't let the fancy math get you down. The variance is just the sum of the squared values of each value minus the average for that value divided by the number of values.  This is a little more complicated that what you have done before but you can definitely do this.

.. activecode:: act_kiva_11
    :include: act_kiva_1

    Calculate the standard deviation of the ``loan_amount`` variable and store the variance in ``loan_var`` and the standard deviation in ``loan_stdev``.

            self.assertAlmostEqual(loan_var, 250456.0, 1, "")
            self.assertAlmostEqual(loan_stdev, 500.456, 3,  "Hint: x ** 0.5  is the same as the square root")

In data science we are often most interested in two variables that seem to influence one another.  That is, we can observe that as one variable grows a second grows with it, or as one variable grows another variable shrinks at a similar rate.  We will look at two ways to explore the relationships between these variables.

**Covariance** measures the larger values of one variable correspond to the larger values of a second variable as well as the extent to which the smaller values of one variable correspond to the smaller values of a second variable.  If the covariance is positive it  means the two variables grow together (positive correlation).  If the magnitude is negative it means one variable grows while the other shrinks.  The magnitude is hard to interpret because it depends on the values of the variables.  So Most often the covariance is normalized so that the values are between minus 1 and positive 1, this is the **pearson correlation coefficient**  A -1 indicates a strong negative correlation, a value of 0 indicates that the variables are not correlated at all, and a +1 indicates a strong positive correlation.

Historically, the pearson correlation coefficient has been used in recommender systems to find groups of like minded shoppers that can recommend products to each other.  It was the basis of Amazon.com's recommender system from 1997 to 2000.  I know this because I was part of the team that wrote that software :-)


.. math::

    covariance = \frac{\sum{(x -\bar{x}) \cdot (y-\bar{y})}}{n}


.. math::

    pearson = \frac{covariance(x,y)}{std(x) std(y)}


.. activecode:: act_kiva_12
    :include: act_kiva_1

    Calculate the pearson correlation between the loan_amount and the num_lenders_total or between time_to_raise and the loan_amount or between num_lenders_total and time_to_raise.  If you divide up the class you can compare values to see which pair has the strongest correlation.
