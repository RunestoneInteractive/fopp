Exercises
=========

.. activecode:: ac6_8_1
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   1. Write code to create a list of integers from 0 through 52 and assign that list to the variable ``numbers``. You should use a special Python function -- do not type out the whole list yourself. HINT: You can do this in one line of code!
   ~~~~

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(numbers, range(53), "Testing that numbers is a list that contains the correct elements.")

   myTests().main()


.. activecode:: ac6_8_2
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   1.1 Write code to create a list of numbers from 0 to 67 and assign that list to the variable ``nums``. Do not hard code the list.
   ~~~~

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(nums, range(68), "Testing that nums is a list that contains the correct elements.")

   myTests().main()

.. activecode:: ac6_8_3
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   2. Assign an empty string to the variable ``output``. Using the ``range`` function, write code to make it so that the variable ``output`` has 35 ``a`` s inside it (like ``"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"``). Hint: use the accumulation pattern!
   ~~~~

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testThree(self):
         self.assertEqual(output, "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "Testing that output has the correct value.")
         self.assertNotIn("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", self.getEditorText(), "Testing your code (Don't worry about actual and expected values).")

   myTests().main()

.. activecode:: ac6_8_4
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   2.1 Create an empty string and assign it to the variable ``lett``. Then using range, write code such that when your code is run, ``lett`` has 7 b's (``"bbbbbbb"``).
   ~~~~

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(lett, "bbbbbbb", "Testing that lett has the correct value." )
         self.assertNotIn("bbbbbbb", self.getEditorText(), "Testing your code (Don't worry about actual and expected values).")

   myTests().main()

.. activecode:: ac6_8_5
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   3. Given the list of numbers, ``numbs``, create a new list of those same numbers increased by 5. Save this new list to the variable ``newlist``.
   ~~~~
   numbs = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testFour(self):
         self.assertEqual(newlist, [10, 15, 20, 25, 30], "Testing that the newlist value contains the correct elements.")

   myTests().main()

.. activecode:: ac6_8_6
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   3.1 For each number in ``lst_nums``, multiply that number by 2 and append it to a new list called ``larger_nums``.
   ~~~~
   lst_nums = [4, 29, 5.3, 10, 2, 1817, 1967, 9, 31.32]

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(larger_nums, [8, 58, 10.6, 20, 4, 3634, 3934, 18, 62.64], "Testing that larger_nums has been created correctly." )

   myTests().main()


.. activecode:: ac6_8_7
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   4. **Challenge** Now do the same as in problem 4, but do not create a new list. Overwrite the list ``numbs`` so that each of the original numbers are increased by 5.
   ~~~~
   numbs = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testFive(self):
         self.assertEqual(numbs, [10, 15, 20, 25, 30], "Testing that numbs is assigned to correct values.")

   myTests().main()



.. activecode:: ac6_8_8
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   5. Count the number of characters in string ``str1``. Do not use ``len()``. Save the number in variable ``numbs``.
   ~~~~
   str1 = "I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living."

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testEight(self):
         self.assertEqual(numbs, 90, "Testing that numbs is assigned to correct values.")
         self.assertNotIn("len(", self.getEditorText(), "Testing your code (Don't worry about actual and expected values).")

   myTests().main()

.. activecode:: ac6_8_9
   :language: python
   :autograde: unittest

   6. Create a list of numbers 0 through 40 and assign this list to the variable ``numbers``. Then, accumulate the total of the list's values and assign that sum to the variable ``sum1``.
   ~~~~

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testNineA(self):
         self.assertEqual(numbers, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], "Testing that numbers is assigned to correct values.")

      def testNineB(self):
         self.assertEqual(sum1, 820, "Testing that sum1 has the correct value.")

   myTests().main()
