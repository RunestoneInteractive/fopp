Introduction: Iteration
=======================

A basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some code
over and over again.  In computing, we refer to this repetitive execution as **iteration**.  In this section, we will explore some mechanisms for basic iteration.

With collections (lists and strings), a lot of computations involve processing one item at a time.  
For strings this means that we would like to process one character at a time.
Often we start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something
to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of processing is called a
**traversal**, or **iteration over the characters**. Similarly, we can process each of the items in a list, one at a time,
**iteration over the items in the list**.

.. Iteration Simplifies our Turtle Program
.. Add “here’s what we can do with turtle now, if we use iteration”; borrow from thinkcspy


.. To draw a square we’d like to do the same thing four times — move the turtle forward some distance and turn 90 degrees. We previously used 8 lines of Python code to have alex draw the four sides of a square. This next program does exactly the same thing but, with the help of the for statement, uses just three lines (not including the setup code). Remember that the for statement will repeat the forward and left four times, one time for each value in the list.
