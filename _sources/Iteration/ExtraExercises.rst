Extra Exercises
===============

1. (You may work on on this one in class. Feel free to start thinking about it.) In Robert McCloskey's
   book *Make Way for Ducklings*, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack,
   Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack.  This loop tries to output these names in order.

.. sourcecode:: python

   prefixes = "JKLMNOPQ"
   suffix = "ack"

   for p in prefixes:
       print(p + suffix)


Of course, that's not quite right because Ouack and Quack are misspelled.
Can you fix it?

2. Get the user to enter some text and print it out in reverse order.

.. actex:: ex6_9_2


3. Get the user to enter some text and print out True if it's a palindrome, False otherwise. (Hint: reuse
some of your code from the last question. The == operator compares two values to see if they are the same)

.. actex:: ex6_9_3
