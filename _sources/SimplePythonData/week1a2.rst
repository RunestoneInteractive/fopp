**Check your understanding**

    :topics: SimplePythonData/FunctionCalls

    There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called ``square``. It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called ``xyz`` the value ``5*5`` (five squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with ``*``.
    ~~~~
    xyz = ""

    =====

    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
            self.assertEqual(type(xyz), type(3), "Checking type of xyz")
            self.assertEqual(xyz, 25, "Checking if xyz is 25")
            self.assertIn('square', self.getEditorText(), "Testing that 'square' is in your code. (Don't worry about Actual and Expected Values.)")

    myTests().main()

    Write code to assign the number of *characters* in the string ``rv`` to a variable ``num_chars``.
    ~~~~
    rv = """Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
        'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door;
        Only this and nothing more."""

    # Write your code here!

    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
           self.assertEqual(num_chars, len(rv), "Testing that num_chars has been set to the length of rv")

.. mchoice:: assess_question1_1_1_3
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: a = len("hello worldwelcome!")
   :answer_b: a = 11 + 8
   :answer_c: a = len(z) + len(y)
   :answer_d: a = len("hello world") + len("welcome!")
   :answer_e: none of the above are hardcoding.
   :feedback_a: Though we are using the len function here, we are hardcoding what len should return the length of. We are not referencing z or y.
   :feedback_b: This is hardcoding, we are writing in the value without referencing z or y.
   :feedback_c: This is not considered hard coding. We are using the function len to determine the length of what is stored in z and y, which is a correct way to approach this problem.
   :feedback_d: Though we are using the len function here, we are hardcoding what len should return the length of each time we call len. We are not referencing z or y.
   :feedback_e: At least one of these solutions is considered hardcoding. Take another look.
   :correct: a,b,d
   :practice: T
   :topics: SimplePythonData/StatementsandExpressions

   The code below initializes two variables, ``z`` and ``y``. We want to assign the total number of characters in ``z`` and in ``y`` to the variable ``a``. Which of the following solutions, if any, would be considered hard coding?

   .. sourcecode:: python

    z = "hello world"
    y = "welcome!"

    (This is not an assessment question) The code below defines functions used by one of the questions above. Do not modify the code, but feel free to take a look.

        return num**2
