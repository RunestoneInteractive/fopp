Variable Names and Keywords
---------------------------

**Variable names** can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and
digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore. Although it is
legal to use uppercase letters, by convention we don't. If you do, remember
that case matters. ``Bruce`` and ``bruce`` are different variables.

.. caution::

   Variable names can never contain spaces.

The underscore character ( ``_``) can also appear in a name. It is often used in
names with multiple words, such as ``my_name`` or ``price_of_tea_in_china``.
There are some situations in which names beginning with an underscore have
special meaning, so a safe rule for beginners is to start all names with a
letter.

If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error.  In the example below, each
of the variable names is illegal.

::

    76trombones = "big parade"
    more$ = 1000000
    class = "Computer Science 101"


``76trombones`` is illegal because it does not begin with a letter.  ``more$``
is illegal because it contains an illegal character, the dollar sign. But
what's wrong with ``class``?

It turns out that ``class`` is one of the Python **keywords**. Keywords define
the language's syntax rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable
names.
Python has thirty-something keywords (and every now and again improvements to
Python introduce or eliminate one or two).  This list is current as of Python
version 3.5:

======== ======== ======== ======== ======== ========
and      as       assert   async    await    break
class    continue def      del      elif     else
except   finally  for      from     global   if
import   in       is       lambda   nonlocal not
or       pass     raise    return   try      while
with     yield    True     False    None
======== ======== ======== ======== ======== ========

You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one
of your variable names and you don't know why, see if it is on this list.
