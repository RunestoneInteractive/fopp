This chapter introduces several basic building blocks of Python programs:

- literals, like numbers and character strings
- operators, like ``+`` and ``*``
- function calls, which take values as inputs and compute new values
- variables, which save values so they can be used later in the program

Learning Goals
--------------

* To understand Python's storage model
* To solve problems using the 'accumulator pattern'
* To understand operator precedence
* To distinguish between expressions, values, and printed representations
* To recogonize & explain hard coding


Objectives
----------

* Given some sample code identify variables that reference an object of a particular type
* Given a variable of one type convert it to another
* Simulate evaluation of an expression and assignment statement
* Use reassignment to increment a variable (accumulator pattern)
* Get input from a user and convert the input to the appropriate type
* Identify the following types of values: strings, integers, floats, functions
* Recognize valid vs. invalid variable names
* Write an assignment statement
* Update a reference diagram after reassignment
