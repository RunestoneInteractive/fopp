The Accumulator Pattern with Lists
----------------------------------

We can accumulate values into a list rather than accumulating a single numeric value. Consider, for 
example, the following program which transforms a list into a new list by squaring each of the values.

.. activecode:: iter_accumlist1

   nums = [3, 5, 8]
   accum = []
   for w in nums:
       x = w**2
       accum.append(x)
   print(accum)

Here, we **initialize** the accumulator variable to be an empty list, on line 2.

We **iterate** through the sequence (line 3). On each iteration we transform the item by squaring it (line 4).

The **update** step appends the new item to the list which is stored in the accumulator variable 
(line 5). The update happens using the .append(), which mutates the list rather than using a 
reassignment. Instead, we could have written ``accum = accum + [x]``, or ``accum += [x]``. In either 
case, we'd need to concatenate a list containing x, not just x itself.

At the end, we have accumulated a new list of the same length as the original, but with each item 
transformed into a new item. This is called a mapping operation, and we will revisit it in a later chapter.

Note how this differs from mutating the original list, as you saw in a previous section.

.. mchoice:: question8_9_1
   :answer_a: [4,2,8,6,5]
   :answer_b: [4,2,8,6,5,5]
   :answer_c: [9,7,13,11,10]
   :answer_d: Error, you cannot concatenate inside an append.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: 5 is added to each item before the append is performed.
   :feedback_b: There are too many items in this list.  Only 5 append operations are performed.
   :feedback_c: Yes, the for loop processes each item of the list.  5 is added before it is appended to blist.
   :feedback_d: 5 is added to each item before the append operation is performed.

   What is printed by the following statements?

     alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
     blist = [ ]
     for item in alist:
        blist.append(item+5)
     print(blist)

   :answer_c: [3,0,9,4,1,7,5]
   :answer_d: Error, you cannot concatenate inside an append.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: 5 is added to each list[i] before the append is performed.
   :feedback_b: Yes, the for loop processes each list[i] of the list.  5 is added before list[i] is appended to blist.
   :feedback_c: There are too many items in this list.  Only 5 append operations are performed.
   :feedback_d: 5 is added to each list[i] before the append operation is performed.

   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

     list= [3,0,9,4,1,7]
     new_list=[]
     for i in range(len(list)):
        new_list.append(list[i]+5)
     print(new_list)
