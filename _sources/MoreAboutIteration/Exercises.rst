              **1.** Using a while loop, create a list ``numbers`` that contains the numbers 0 through 35. Your while loop should initialize a counter variable to 0. On each iteration, the loop should append the current value of the counter to the list and the counter should increase by 1. The while loop should stop when the counter is greater than 35.

.. question:: moreiter_ex_2

   .. actex:: ac14_9_2

      Using a while loop, create a list called ``L`` that contains the numbers 0 to 10. (i.e.: Your while loop should initialize a counter variable to 0. On each iteration, the loop should append the current value of the counter variable to ``L`` and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than 10.)

              Using a while loop, create a list called ``nums`` that contains the numbers 0 though 20. (i.e: your while looop should initialize a counter variable on 0. During each iteration, the loop should append the current value of the counter variable to ``nums`` and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than 20)
