   The code below takes the list of country, ``country``, and searches to see if it is in the dictionary ``gold`` which shows some countries who won gold during the Olympics. However, this code currently does not work. Correctly add try/except clause in the code so that it will correctly populate the list, ``country_gold``, with either the number of golds won or the string "Did not get gold".

   for x in country:

   The list, ``numb``, contains integers. Write code that populates the list ``remainder`` with the remainder of 36 divided by each number in ``numb``. For example, the first element should be 0, because 36/6 has no remainder. If there is an error, have the string "Error" appear in the ``remainder``.

   The following code tries to append the third element of each list in ``conts`` to the new list ``third_countries``. Currently, the code does not work. Add a try/except clause so the code runs without errors, and the string 'Continent does not have 3 countries' is appended to ``third_countries`` instead of producing an error.
