Tuple Assignment with Unpacking
-------------------------------

Python has a very powerful **tuple assignment** feature that allows a tuple of variable names on the left of an
assignment statement to be assigned values from a tuple on the right of the assignment. Another way to think of this
is that the tuple of values is **unpacked** into the variable names.

.. activecode:: ac12_4_1

    julia = "Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia"

    name, surname, birth_year, movie, movie_year, profession, birth_place = julia

This does the equivalent of seven assignment statements, all on one easy line.

Naturally, the number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right have to be the same.

.. activecode:: ac12_4_4

    (a, b, c, d) = (1, 2, 3) # ValueError: need more than 3 values to unpack



.. note::

    Unpacking into multiple variable names also works with lists, or any other sequence type, as long as there is exactly one value for each variable. For example, you can write ``x, y = [3, 4]``.

Swapping Values between Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature is used to enable swapping the values of two variables. With conventional assignment statements, we have to
use a temporary variable. For example, to swap ``a`` and ``b``:

.. activecode:: ac12_4_2

    a = 1
    b = 2
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
    print(a, b, temp)

Tuple assignment solves this problem neatly:

.. activecode:: ac12_4_3

    a = 1
    b = 2
    (a, b) = (b, a)
    print(a, b)

The left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of values. Each value is assigned to its respective
variable. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the assignments. This feature makes
tuple assignment quite versatile.


Unpacking Into Iterator Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple assignment with unpacking is particularly useful when you iterate through a list of tuples. You can unpack each tuple into several loop variables. For example:

.. activecode:: ac12_4_8a

    authors = [('Paul', 'Resnick'), ('Brad', 'Miller'), ('Lauren', 'Murphy')]
    for first_name, last_name in authors:
        print("first name:", first_name, "last name:", last_name)

On the first iteration the tuple ``('Paul', 'Resnick')`` is unpacked into the two variables ``first_name`` and ``last_name``. One the second iteration, the next tuple is unpacked into those same loop variables.



.. _pythonic_enumeration:

The Pythonic Way to Enumerate Items in a Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we first introduced the for loop, we provided an example of how to iterate through the indexes of a sequence, and thus enumerate the items and their positions in the sequence.

.. activecode:: ac12_4_8b

   fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']
   for n in range(len(fruits)):
       print(n, fruits[n])

We are now prepared to understand a more pythonic approach to enumerating items in a sequence. Python provides a built-in function ``enumerate``. It takes a sequence as input and returns a sequence of tuples. In each tuple, the first element is an integer and the second is an item from the original sequence. (It actually produces an "iterable" rather than a list, but we can use it in a for loop as the sequence to iterate over.)

.. activecode:: ac12_4_8c

   fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']
   for item in enumerate(fruits):
       print(item[0], item[1])

The pythonic way to consume the results of enumerate, however, is to unpack the tuples while iterating through them, so that the code is easier to understand.

.. activecode:: ac12_4_8d

   fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']
   for idx, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
       print(idx, fruit)

   :answer_a: You can't use different variable names on the left and right side of an assignment statement.
   :answer_b: At the end, x still has it's original value instead of y's original value.
   :answer_c: Actually, it works just fine!
   :feedback_a: Sure you can; you can use any variable on the right-hand side that already has a value.
   :feedback_b: Once you assign x's value to y, y's original value is gone.
   :feedback_c: Once you assign x's value to y, y's original value is gone.
   :correct: b

   Consider the following alternative way to swap the values of variables x and y. What's wrong with it?

   .. code-block:: python

        # assume x and y already have values assigned to them
        y = x
        x = y

   If you remember, the .items() dictionary method produces a sequence of tuples. Keeping this in mind, we have provided you a dictionary called ``pokemon``. For every key value pair, append the key to the list ``p_names``, and append the value to the list ``p_number``. Do not use the .keys() or .values() methods.
