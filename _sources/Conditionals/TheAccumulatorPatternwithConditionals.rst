The Accumulator Pattern with Conditionals
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes when we're accumulating, we don't want to add to our accumulator every time we iterate.
Consider, for example, the following program which counts the number of letters in a phrase.

.. activecode:: ac7_6_1

   phrase = "What a wonderful day to program"
   tot = 0
   for char in phrase:
       if char != " ":
           tot = tot + 1
   print(tot)

Here, we **initialize** the accumulator variable to be zero on line two.

We **iterate** through the sequence (line 3).

The **update** step happens in two parts. First, we check to see if the value of ``char`` is not a space. If 
it is not a space, then we update the value of our accumulator variable ``tot`` (on line 6) by adding one to 
it. If that conditional proves to be False, which means that char *is* a space, then we don't update ``tot`` 
and continue the for loop. We could have written ``tot = tot + 1`` or ``tot += 1``, either is fine. 

At the end, we have accumulated a the total number of letters in the phrase. Without using the conditional, 
we would have only been able to count how many characters there are in the string and not been able to 
differentiate between spaces and non-spaces.

We can use conditionals to also count if particular items are in a string or list. The following code finds all occurances of vowels in the following string.

.. activecode:: ac7_6_2

    s = "what if we went to the zoo"
    x = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
            x += 1
    print(x)


Accumulating the Max Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can also use the accumulation pattern with conditionals to find the maximum or minimum value. Instead of 
continuing to build up the accumulator value like we have when counting or finding a sum, we can reassign the 
accumulator variable to a different value.

The following example shows how we can get the maximum value from a list of integers.

.. activecode:: ac7_6_3

   nums = [9, 3, 8, 11, 5, 29, 2]
   best_num = 0
   for n in nums:
       if n > best_num:
           best_num = n
   print(best_num)

Here, we initalize best_num to zero, assuming that there are no negative numbers in the list.

In the for loop, we check to see if the current value of n is greater than the current value of ``best_num``. 
If it is, then we want to **update** ``best_num`` so that it now is assigned the higher number. Otherwise, we 
do nothing and continue the for loop.

You may notice that the current structure could be a problem. If the numbers were all negative what would 
happen to our code? What if we were looking for the smallest number but we initialized ``best_num`` with 
zero? To get around this issue, we can initialize the accumulator variable using one of the numbers in the 
list.

.. activecode:: ac7_6_4

   nums = [9, 3, 8, 11, 5, 29, 2]
   best_num = nums[0]
   for n in nums:
       if n > best_num:
           best_num = n
   print(best_num)

The only thing we changed was the value of ``best_num`` on line 2 so that the value of ``best_num`` is the 
first element in ``nums``, but the result is still the same!

   :answer_d: There is an error in the code so it cannot run.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Though only two of the letters in the list are found, we count them each time they appear.
   :feedback_b: Yes, we add to x each time we come across a letter in the list.
   :feedback_c: Check again what the conditional is evaluating. The value of i will be a character in the string s, so what will happen in the if statement?
   :feedback_d: There are no errors in this code.

   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

     s = "We are learning!"
     x = 0
     for i in s:
         if i in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']:
             x += 1
     print(x)

   :answer_d: There is an error in the code so it cannot run.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Not quite. What is the conditional checking?
   :feedback_b: min_value was set to a number that was smaller than any of the numbers in the list, so it was never updated in the for loop.
   :feedback_c: Yes, min_value was set to a number that was smaller than any of the numbers in the list, so it was never updated in the for loop.
   :feedback_d: The code does not have an error that would prevent it from running.

   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

     list= [5, 2, 1, 4, 9, 10]
     min_value = 0
     for item in list:
        if item < min_value:
            min_value = item
     print(min_value)
