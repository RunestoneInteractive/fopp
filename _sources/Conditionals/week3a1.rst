    ``rainfall_mi`` is a string that contains the average number of inches of rainfall in Michigan for every month (in inches) with every month separated by a comma.
    Write code to compute the number of months that have more than 3 inches of rainfall. Store the result in the variable ``num_rainy_months``.
    In other words, count the number of items with values ``> 3.0``.


    Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.

    The variable ``sentence`` stores a string. Write code to determine how many words in ``sentence`` start and end with the same letter, including one-letter words.
    Store the result in the variable ``same_letter_count``.

    Write code to count the number of strings in list ``items`` that have the character ``w`` in it. Assign that number to the variable ``acc_num``.

    HINT 1: Use the accumulation pattern!

    HINT 2: the ``in`` operator checks whether a substring is present in a string.

    Write code that counts the number of words in ``sentence`` that contain *either* an "a" or an "e". Store the result in the variable ``num_a_or_e``.

    Note 1: be sure to not double-count words that contain both an a and an e.

    HINT 1: Use the ``in`` operator.

    HINT 2: You can either use ``or`` or ``elif``.

    Write code that will count the number of vowels in the sentence ``s`` and assign the result to the variable ``num_vowels``. For this problem, vowels are only a, e, i, o, and u. Hint: use the ``in`` operator with ``vowels``.

   Create one conditional so that if "Friendly" is in ``w``, then "Friendly is here!" should be assigned to the variable ``wrd``. If it's not, check if "Friend" is in ``w``. If so, the string "Friend is here!" should be assigned to the variable ``wrd``, otherwise "No variation of friend is in here." should be assigned to the variable ``wrd``. (Also consider: does the order of your conditional statements matter for this problem? Why?)

   For each string in ``wrd_lst``, find the number of characters in the string. If the number of characters is less than 6, add 1 to ``accum`` so that in the end, ``accum`` will contain an integer representing the total number of words in the list that have fewer than 6 characters.
