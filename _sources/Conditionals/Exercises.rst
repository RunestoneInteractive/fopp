            .. actex:: ac7_14_1

               Write code that asks the user to enter a numeric score (0-100). In response, it should print out the score and corresponding letter grade, according to the table below.
        
               .. table::
        
                  =======   =====
                  Score     Grade
                  =======   =====
                  >= 90     A
                  [80-90)   B
                  [70-80)   C
                  [60-70)   D
                  < 60      F
                  =======   =====
        
               The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals.
               A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.

           .. actex:: ac7_14_2

               A year is a **leap year** if it is divisible by 4. If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless the year is **also** evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year. Write code that asks the user to input a year and output True if it's a leap year, or False otherwise. Use if statements.
    
               .. table::
    
                  =======  =====

               Given the lengths of three sides of a triange, determine whether the triangle is right angled. If it is, the assign ``True`` to the variable ``is_rightangled``. If it's not, then assign ``False`` to the variable ``is_rightangled``.

               Hint: floating point arithmetic is not always exactly accurate,
               so it is not safe to test floating point numbers for equality.

               ``x`` is equal or close enough to ``y``, they would probably code it up as

               Implement the calculator for the date of Easter.
   
               The following algorithm computes the date for Easter Sunday for any year between 1900 to 2099.
   
               Ask the user to enter a year.
               Compute the following:
   
   
   
                   1. a = year % 19
                   #. b = year % 4
                   #. c = year % 7
                   #. d = (19 * a + 24) % 30
                   #. e = (2 * b + 4 * c + 6 * d + 5) % 7
                   #. dateofeaster = 22 + d + e
   
   
               Special note: The algorithm can give a date in April.  You will know that the date is in April if the calculation gives you an answer greater than 31.  (You'll need to adjust)  Also, if the year is one of four special
               years (1954, 1981, 2049, or 2076) then subtract 7 from the date.
   
               Your program should print an error message if the user provides a date that is out of range.
