.. mchoice:: assess_question3_1_1_1
   :answer_a: I.
   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: Neither is the correct reference diagram.
   :feedback_a: Yes, when we are using the remove method, we are just editing the existing list, not making a new copy.
   :feedback_b: When we use the remove method, we just edit the existing list. We do not make a new copy that does not include the removed object.
   :feedback_c: One of the diagrams is correct - look again at what is happening to lst.
   :correct: a
   :practice: T
   :topics: 

   Which of these is a correct reference diagram following the execution of the following code?

   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    lst = ['mercury', 'venus', 'earth', 'mars', 'jupiter', 'saturn', 'uranus', 'neptune', 'pluto']
    lst.remove('pluto')
    first_three = lst[:2]

   I.

.. mchoice:: assess_question3_1_1_2
   :answer_a: I.
   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: III.
   :answer_d: IV.
   :feedback_a: Yes, when we make our own diagrams we want to keep the old information because sometimes other variables depend on them. It can get cluttered though if there is a lot of information.
   :feedback_b: Not quite, we want to keep track of old information because sometimes other variables depend on them. 
   :feedback_c: Look again at what is happening when join is executed.
   :feedback_d: What happens to the spaces in a string when it is split by whitespace?
   :correct: a
   :practice: T
   :topics: 

   Which of these is a correct reference diagram following the execution of the following code?

   .. sourcecode:: python

    sent = "The mall has excellent sales right now."
    wrds = sent.split()
    wrds[1] = 'store'
    new_sent = " ".join(wrds)

.. mchoice:: assess_question3_2_1_1_6
   :answer_a: .pop()
   :answer_b: .insert()
   :answer_c: .count()
   :answer_d: .index()
   :feedback_a: pop removes and returns items (default is to remove and return the last item in the list) 
   :feedback_b: insert will add an item at whatever position is specified.
   :feedback_c: count returns the number of times something occurs in a list
   :feedback_d: Yes, index will return the position of the first occurance of an item.
   :correct: d
   :practice: T
   :topics: 

   Which method would you use to figure out the position of an item in a list?

.. mchoice:: assess_question3_2_1_1_7
   :answer_a: .insert()
   :answer_b: .pop()
   :answer_c: .append()
   :answer_d: .remove()
   :feedback_a: While you can use insert, it is not the best method to use because you need to specify that you want to stick the new item at the end.
   :feedback_b: pop removes an item from a list
   :feedback_c: Yes, though you can use insert to do the same thing, you don't need to provide the position.
   :feedback_d: remove gets rid of the first occurance of any item that it is told. It does not add an item.
   :correct: c
   :practice: T
   :topics: 

   Which method best to use when adding an item to the end of a list?
