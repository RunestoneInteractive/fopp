   :answer_a: I.
   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: III.
   :answer_d: none of the above would be appropriate for the problem.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This pattern will only count how many items are in the list, not provide the total accumulated value.
   :feedback_b: This would reset the value of s each time the for loop iterated, and so by the end s would be assigned the value of the last item in the list plus the last item in the list.
   :feedback_c: Yes, this will solve the problem.
   :feedback_d: One of the patterns above is a correct way to solve the problem.
   :practice: T

   Given that we want to accumulate the total sum of a list of numbers, which of the following accumulator patterns would be appropriate?
   
   I.
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    nums = [4, 5, 2, 93, 3, 5]
    s = 0
    for n in nums:
        s = s + 1
   
   II.
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    nums = [4, 5, 2, 93, 3, 5]
    s = 0
    for n in nums:
        s = n + n
   
   III.
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    nums = [4, 5, 2, 93, 3, 5]
    s = 0
    for n in nums:
        s = s + n

.. mchoice:: assess_question5_2_1_2
   :answer_a: I.
   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: III.
   :answer_d: IV.
   :answer_e: none of the above would be appropriate for the problem. 
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: How does this solution know that the element of lst is a string and that s should be updated?
   :feedback_b: What happens to s each time the for loop iterates?
   :feedback_c: Reread the prompt again, what do we want to accumulate?
   :feedback_d: Yes, this will solve the problem.
   :feedback_e: One of the patterns above is a correct way to solve the problem.
   :practice: T

   Given that we want to accumulate the total number of strings in the list, which of the following accumulator patterns would be appropriate?

   I.
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    lst = ['plan', 'answer', 5, 9.29, 'order, items', [4]]
    s = 0
    for n in nums:
        s = s + n
   
   II.
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    lst = ['plan', 'answer', 5, 9.29, 'order, items', [4]]
    for n in nums:
        s = 0
        if type(n) == type("string"):
            s = s + 1
   
   III.
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    lst = ['plan', 'answer', 5, 9.29, 'order, items', [4]]
    s = ""
    for n in nums:
        s = s + n
   
   IV.
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    lst = ['plan', 'answer', 5, 9.29, 'order, items', [4]]
    s = 0
    for n in nums:
        if type(n) == type("string"):
            s = s + 1
 
.. mchoice:: assess_question5_2_1_3
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: sum
   :answer_b: x
   :answer_c: total
   :answer_d: accum
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: c,d
   :feedback_a: No, though sum might be clear, it is also the name of a commonly used function in Python, and so there can be issues if sum is used as an accumulator variable.
   :feedback_b: No, x is not a clear enough name to be used for an accumulator variable.
   :feedback_c: Yes, total is a good name for accumulating numbers.
   :feedback_d: Yes, accum is a good name. It's both short and easy to remember.
   :feedback_e: At least one of the answers above is a good name for an accumulator variable.
   :practice: T

   Which of these are good names for an accumulator variable? Select as many as apply.

.. mchoice:: assess_question5_2_1_4
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: item
   :answer_b: y
   :answer_c: elem
   :answer_d: char
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: a,c,d
   :feedback_a: Yes, item can be a good name to use as an iterator variable.
   :feedback_b: No, y is not likely to be a clear name for the iterator variable.
   :feedback_c: Yes, elem can be a good name to use as an iterator variable, especially when iterating over lists.
   :feedback_d: Yes, char can be a good name to use when iterating over a string, because the iterator variable would be assigned a character each time.
   :feedback_e: At least one of the answers above is a good name for an iterator variable.
   :practice: T

   Which of these are good names for an iterator variable? Select as many as apply.

.. mchoice:: assess_question5_2_1_5
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: num_lst
   :answer_b: p
   :answer_c: sentence
   :answer_d: names
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: a,c,d
   :feedback_a: Yes, num_lst is good for a sequence variable if the value is actually a list of numbers.
   :feedback_b: No, p is not likely to be a clear name for the iterator variable.
   :feedback_c: Yes, this is good to use if the for loop is iterating through a string.
   :feedback_d: Yes, names is good, assuming that the for loop is iterating through actual names and not something unrelated to names.
   :feedback_e: At least one of the answers above is a good name for a sequence variable
   :practice: T

   Which of these are good names for a sequence variable? Select as many as apply.

.. mchoice:: assess_question5_2_1_6
   :answer_a: accumulator variable: x | iterator variable: s | sequence variable: lst
   :answer_b: accumulator variable: total | iterator variable: s | sequence variable: lst
   :answer_c: accumulator variable: x | iterator variable: sentences | sequence variable: word_lst
   :answer_d: accumulator variable: total | iterator variable: sentences |sequence variable: word_lst
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Though lst may be a good name, x and s are not clear names for accumulator and iterator variables.
   :feedback_b: Though total, and lst may be good names, there is a more clear option since s is not very clear.
   :feedback_c: Though sentences and word_lst are good names, x is not the best name for an accumulator variable.
   :feedback_d: Yes, this combination of variable names is the most clear.
   :feedback_e: One of the options above has good names for the scenario.
   :practice: T

   Given the following scenario, what are good names for the accumulator variable, iterator variable, and sequence variable? You are writing code that uses a list of sentences and accumulates the total number of sentences that have the word 'happy' in them.
