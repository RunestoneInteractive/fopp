Introduction: Class Inheritance
===============================

Classes can "inherit" methods and class variables from other classes. We'll see the mechanics of how this works in 
subsequent sections. First, however, let's motivate why this might be valuable. It turns out that inheritance doesn't 
let you do anything that you couldn't do without it, but it makes some things a lot more elegant. You will also find 
it's useful when someone else has defined a class in a module or library, and you just want to override a few things 
without having to reimplement everything they've done.

Consider our Tamagotchi game. Suppose we wanted to make some different kinds of pets that have the same structure as 
other pets, but have some different attributes or behave a little differently. For example, suppose that dog pets 
should show their emotional state a little differently than cats or act differently when they are hungry or when they 
are asked to fetch something.

You could implement this by making instance variable for the pet type and dispatching on that instance variable in 
various methods.

.. code:: python

    from random import randrange

    class Pet():
        boredom_decrement = 4
        hunger_decrement = 6
        boredom_threshold = 5
        hunger_threshold = 10
        sounds = ['Mrrp']
        def __init__(self, name = "Kitty", pet_type="dog"):
            self.name = name
            self.hunger = randrange(self.hunger_threshold)
            self.boredom = randrange(self.boredom_threshold)
            self.sounds = self.sounds[:]  # copy the class attribute, so that when we make changes to it, we won't affect the other Pets in the class
            self.pet_type = pet_type

        def clock_tick(self):
            self.boredom += 1
            self.hunger += 1

        def mood(self):
            if self.hunger <= self.hunger_threshold and self.boredom <= self.boredom_threshold:
                if self.pet_type == "dog": # if the pet is a dog, it will express its mood in different ways from a cat or any other type of animal
                    return "happy"
                elif self.pet_type == "cat":
                    return "happy, probably"
                else:
                    return "HAPPY"
            elif self.hunger > self.hunger_threshold:
                if self.pet_type == "dog": # same for hunger -- dogs and cats will express their hunger a little bit differently in this version of the class definition
                    return "hungry, arf"
                elif self.pet_type == "cat":
                    return "hungry, meeeeow"
                else:
                    return "hungry"
            else:
                return "bored"

        def __str__(self):
            state = "     I'm " + self.name + ". "
            state += " I feel " + self.mood() + ". "
            return state

        def hi(self):
            print(self.sounds[randrange(len(self.sounds))])
            self.reduce_boredom()

        def teach(self, word):
            self.sounds.append(word)
            self.reduce_boredom()

        def feed(self):
            self.reduce_hunger()

        def reduce_hunger(self):
            self.hunger = max(0, self.hunger - self.hunger_decrement)

        def reduce_boredom(self):
            self.boredom = max(0, self.boredom - self.boredom_decrement)


That code is exactly the same as the code defining the ``Pet`` class that you saw in the Tamagotchi section, except that 
we've added a few things.
* A new input to the constructor -- the ``pet_type`` input parameter, which defaults to ``"dog"``, and the ``self.pet_type`` instance variable.
* if..elif..else in the ``self.mood()`` method, such that different types of pets (a dog, a cat, or any other type of animal) express their moods and their hunger in slightly different ways.

But that's not an elegant way to do it. It obscures the parts of being a pet that are common to all pets and it 
buries the unique stuff about being a dog or a cat in the middle of the mood method. What if you also wanted a dog to 
reduce boredom at a different rate than a cat, and you wanted a bird pet to be different still? Here, we've only 
implemented **dogs**, **cats**, and **other** -- but you can imagine the possibilities.

If there were lots of different types of pets, those methods would start to have long and complex **if..elif..elif** 
code clauses, which can be confusing. And you'd need that in every method where the behavior was different for 
different types of pets. Class inheritance will give us a more elegant way to do it.
