Exercises
=========

For exercises, you can expand the Tamagotchi game even further. Try doing these on your own.

Here's *all* the code we just saw for our new and improved game, with a few additions. You can run this and play the game 
again.

#. Change the above code to allow you to adopt a Tiger pet (that you're about to create). HINT: look at the ``whichtype`` function, and think about what's happening in the code for that function.

#. Now, modify the code to define a new class, ``Tiger``. The ``Tiger`` class should inherit from the ``Cat`` class, but its default meow count should be ``5``, not ``3``, and it should have an extra instance method, ``roar``, that prints out the string ``ROOOOOAR!``. 

#. Next, modify the code so that when the ``hi`` method is called for the ``Tiger`` class, the ``roar`` method is called. HINT: You'll have to call one instance method inside another, and you'll have to redefine a method for the ``Tiger`` class. See the **overriding methods** section. 

#. Now, modify the code to define another new class, ``Retriever``. This class should inherit from ``Lab``. It should be exactly like ``Lab``, except instead of printing just ``I found the tennis ball!`` when the ``fetch`` method is called, it should say ``I found the tennis ball! I can fetch anything!``.


#. Add your own new pets and modifications as you like -- remember, to use them in the game, you'll also have to alter the ``whichtype`` function so they can be used in game play. Otherwise, you'll have different classes that may work just fine, but you won't see the effects in the game, since the code that actually makes the game play is found in the second half of the provided code (look for the ``while`` loop!).
