Project - Wheel of Python
=========================

.. activecode:: wof_ac_sleep
    :autograde: unittest
    :language: python
    :nocodelens:

    This project will take you through the process of implementing a simplified version of the game **Wheel of Fortune**. Here are the rules of our game:

    * There are ``num_human`` human players and ``num_computer`` computer players.
        * Every player has *some* amount of money ($0 at the start of the game)
        * Every player has a set of prizes (none at the start of the game)
    * The goal is to **guess a phrase within a given category**. For example:
        * Category: **Artist & Song**
        * Phrase: **Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You**
    * Players see the category and an obscured version of the phrase where every alphanumeric character in the phrase starts out as hidden (using underscores: ``_``):
        * Category: **Artist & Song**
        * Phrase: ``_______ _______'_ _ ____ ______ ____ ___``
    * Note that case (capitalization) does not matter
    * During their turn, every player spins the wheel to determine a prize amount and:
        * If the wheel lands on a **cash** square, players may do one of three actions:
            * **Guess any letter** that hasn't been guessed by typing a letter (a-z)
                * Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) cost $250 to guess and can't be guessed if the player doesn't have enough money. All other letters are "free" to guess
                * The player can guess any letter that hasn't been guessed and gets that cash amount for *every time* that letter appears in the phrase
                * If there is a prize, the user also gets that prize (in addition to any prizes they already had)
                * Example: The user lands on $500 and guesses 'W'
                    * There are three W's in the phrase, so the player wins $1500
            * **Guess the complete phrase** by typing a phrase (anything over one character that isn't `'pass'`)
                * If they are correct, they win the game
                * If they are incorrect, it is the next player's turn
            * **Pass** their turn by entering ``'pass'``
        * If the wheel lands on **"lose a turn"**, the player loses their turn and the game moves on to the next player
        * If the wheel lands on **"bankrupt"**, the player loses their turn *and* loses their money. However, they keep all of the prizes they have won so far.
    * The game continues until the entire phrase is revealed (or one player guesses the complete phrase)

    First, let's learn about a few functions and methods that we'll use along the way to do this project. There are no questions to answer in these next few active code windows, they are just here to introduce or reintroduce you to some functions and methods that you may not be aware of. The active code window that starts with "Part A" is where you are first asked to complete code.
    
    The ``time.sleep(s)`` function (from the ``time`` module) delays execution of the next line of code for ``s`` seconds. You'll find that we can build a little suspense during gameplay with some well-placed delays. The game can also be easier for users to understand if not everything happens instantly.

        print('Sleep {} seconds..'.format(x))

    print('Done!')

    :autograde: unittest
    :language: python
    :nocodelens:

    The ``random`` module includes several useful methods for generating and using random numbers, including:

    * ``random.randint(low, high)`` generates a random number between ``low`` and ``high`` (inclusive)
    * ``random.choice(L)`` selects a random item from the list ``L``
    ~~~~
    import random

    rand_number = random.randint(1, 10)
    print('Random number between 1 and 10: {}'.format(rand_number))

    letters = [letter for letter in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ']
    rand_letter = random.choice(letters)
    print('Random letter: {}'.format(rand_letter))
    

.. activecode:: wof_ac_str
    :autograde: unittest
    :language: python
    :nocodelens:

    There are also several string methods that we haven't gone over in detail but will use for this project:

    * ``.upper()`` converts a string to uppercase (the opposite is ``.lower()``)
    * ``.count(s)`` counts how many times the string ``s`` occurs inside of a larger string

    ~~~~
    myString = 'Hello, World! 123'

    print(myString.upper()) # HELLO, WORLD! 123
    print(myString.lower()) # hello, world! 123
    print(myString.count('l')) # 3

    s = 'python is pythonic'
    print(s.count('python')) # 2

.. activecode:: wof_ac_other_methods

    We're going to define a few useful methods for you. Read their implementation and make sure they make sense.

    **Part A: ``WOFPlayer``**

    We're going to start by defining a class to represent a Wheel of Fortune player, called ``WOFPlayer``. Every instance of ``WOFPlayer`` has three instance variables:

    * ``.name``: The name of the player (should be passed into the constructor)
    * ``.prizeMoney``: The amount of prize money for this player (an integer, initialized to ``0``)
    * ``.prizes``: The prizes this player has won so far (a list, initialized to ``[]``)

    It should also have the following methods (note: we will exclude ``self`` in our descriptions):
    
    * ``.addMoney(amt)``: Add ``amt`` to ``self.prizeMoney``
    * ``.goBankrupt()``: Set ``self.prizeMoney`` to ``0``
    * ``.addPrize(prize)``: Add ``prize`` to ``self.prizes``
    * ``.__str__()``: Returns the player's name and prize money in the following format:
        * ``Steve ($1800)`` (for a player with instance variables ``.name == 'Steve'`` and ``prizeMoney == 1800``)

    **Part B: ``WOFHumanPlayer``**
    Next, we're going to define a class named ``WOFHumanPlayer``, which should inherit from ``WOFPlayer`` (part A). This class is going to represent a human player. In addition to having all of the instance variables and methods that ``WOFPlayer`` has, ``WOFHumanPlayer`` should have an additional method:

    * ``.getMove(category, obscuredPhrase, guessed)``: Should ask the user to enter a move and return **whatever they entered** no matter what they enter.

    ``.getMove()``'s prompt should be::

        {name} has ${prizeMoney}

        Category: {category}
        Phrase:  {obscured_phrase}
        Guessed: {guessed}

        Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':
    
    For example::

        Steve has $200

        Category: Places
        Phrase: _L___ER N____N_L P_RK
        Guessed: B, E, K, L, N, P, R, X, Z

        Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':

    The user can then enter:
    * ``'exit'`` to exit the game
    * ``'pass'`` to skip their turn
    * a single character to guess that character
    * a complete phrase -- anything other than ``'exit'`` or ``'pass'`` -- to guess that phrase

    Note that ``.getMove()`` **does not** need to enforce anything about the user's input; that will be done via the game logic.

    **Part C: ``WOFComputerPlayer``**
    Next, we're going to define a class named ``WOFComputerPlayer``, which should inherit from ``WOFPlayer`` (part A). This class is going to represent a computer player.

    Every computer player will have a ``difficulty``, where players with a higher ``difficulty`` generally play "better". There are many ways to implement this. We'll do the following:

    * Semi-randomly decide whether to make a "good" move or a "bad" move on a given turn (a higher difficulty should make it more likely for the player to make a "good" move)
        * If we decide to make a "bad" move, we'll randomly decide on a possible letter
        * If we decide to make a "good" move, we'll choose a letter according to their overall frequency in the English language
    * If there aren't any possible letters to choose (for example: if the last character is a vowel but this player doesn't have enough to guess a vowel), we'll ``'pass'``

    We'll implement this in the ``WOFComputerPlayer`` class. In addition to having all of the instance variables and methods that ``WOFPlayer`` has, ``WOFComputerPlayer`` should have:

    **Class variable**

    * ``.SORTED_FREQUENCIES``: Should be set to ``'ZQXJKVBPYGFWMUCLDRHSNIOATE'``, which is a list of English characters sorted from least frequent (``'Z'``) to most frequent (``'E'``). We'll use this when trying to make a "good" move.

    **Instance variables**

    * ``.difficulty``: The level of difficulty for this computer (should be passed as the second argument into the constructor after ``.name``)


    **Methods**

    * ``.smartCoinFlip()``: This method will help us decide semi-randomly whether to make a "good" or "bad" move (again, a higher difficulty should make us more likely to make a "good" move). You should implement this by choosing a random number between ``1`` and ``10`` using ``random.randint`` (see above) and returning ``True`` if that random number is greater than ``self.difficulty``. If the random number is equal to or less than ``self.difficulty`` then you should return ``False``.
    * ``.getPossibleLetters(guessed)``: This method should return a list of letters that can be guessed.
        * These should be characters that are in ``LETTERS`` (``'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'``) but **not** in the ``guessed`` parameter.
        * Additionally, if this player doesn't have enough prize money to guess a vowel (``VOWEL_COST``), then vowels (``VOWELS``: ``'AEIOU'``) should **not** be included
    * ``.getMove(category, obscuredPhrase, guessed)``: Should return a valid move.
        * Use the ``.getPossibleLetters(guessed)`` method described above.
        * If there aren't any letters that can be guessed (this can happen if the only letters left to guess are vowels and the player doesn't have enough for vowels), return ``'pass'``
        * Use the ``.smartCoinFlip()`` method to decide whether to make a "good" or a "bad" move
            * If making a "good" move (``.smartCoinFlip()`` returns ``True``), then return the most frequent (highest index in ``.SORTED_FREQUENCIES``) possible character
            * If making a "bad" move (``.smartCoinFlip()`` returns ``False``), then return a random character from the set of possible characters (use ``random.choice()``)

    **Putting it together: Wheel of Python**

    Then, paste your code from the previous code window in the correct places below.

    *One more thing*: we added the following code to ensure that the Python interpreter gives our game time to run ``sys.setExecutionLimit(ms)`` says that we should be able to run our program for ``ms`` milliseconds before it gets stopped automatically::
