   The class, ``Pokemon``, is provided below and describes a Pokemon and its leveling and evolving characteristics. An instance of the class is one pokemon that you create.

   ``Grass_Pokemon`` is a subclass that inherits from ``Pokemon`` but changes some aspects, for instance, the boost values are different.

   For the subclass ``Grass_Pokemon``, add another method called ``action`` that returns the string ``"[name of pokemon] knows a lot of different moves!"``. Create an instance of this class with the ``name`` as ``"Belle"``. Assign this instance to the variable ``p1``.

   Modify the ``Grass_Pokemon`` subclass so that the attack strength for ``Grass_Pokemon`` instances does not change until they reach level 10. At level 10 and up, their attack strength should increase by the ``attack_boost`` amount when they are trained.

   To test, create an instance of the class with the name as ``"Bulby"``. Assign the instance to the variable ``p2``. Create another instance of the ``Grass_Pokemon`` class with the name set to ``"Pika"`` and assign that instance to the variable ``p3``. Then, use ``Grass_Pokemon`` methods to train the ``p3`` ``Grass_Pokemon`` instance until it reaches at least level 10.

   Along with the ``Pokemon`` parent class, we have also provided several subclasses. Write another method in the parent class that will be inherited by the subclasses. Call it ``opponent``. It should return which type of pokemon the current type is weak and strong against, as a tuple.

   - **Grass** is weak against *Fire* and strong against *Water*
   - **Ghost** is weak against *Dark* and strong against *Psychic*
   - **Fire** is weak against *Water* and strong against *Grass*
   - **Flying** is weak against *Electric* and strong against *Fighting*

   For example, if the ``p_type`` of the subclass is ``'Grass'``, ``.opponent()`` should return the tuple ``('Fire', 'Water')``
