               The following sample file called ``studentdata.txt`` contains one line for each student in an imaginary class.  The 
               students name is the first thing on each line, followed by some exam scores.  
               The number of scores might be different for each student.

               .. raw:: html

                   <pre id="studentdata.txt">
                   joe 10 15 20 30 40

            Using the text file ``studentdata.txt`` write a program that prints out the names of
            students that have more than six quiz scores. 

            .. actex:: ex_6_1
               :nocodelens:
               :available_files: studentdata.txt

               # Hint: first see if you can write a program that just prints out the number of scores on each line
               # Then, make it print the number only if the number is at least six
               # Then, switch it to printing the name instead of the number
