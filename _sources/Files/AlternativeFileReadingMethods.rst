Alternative File Reading Methods
--------------------------------

Once you have a file "object", the thing returned by the open function, Python provides three methods to read data
from that object. The ``read()`` method returns the entire contents of the file as a single string (or just some 
characters if you provide a number as an input parameter. The ``readlines`` method returns the entire contents of
the entire file as a list of strings, where each item in the list is one line of the file. The ``readline`` 
method reads one line from the file and returns it as a string. The strings returned by ``readlines`` or 
``readline`` will contain the newline character at the end.  :ref:`Table 2 <filemethods2a>` summarizes these 
methods and the following session shows them in action.

.. _filemethods2a:

======================== =========================== =====================================
**Method Name**           **Use**                     **Explanation**
======================== =========================== =====================================
``write``                 ``filevar.write(astring)``  Add astring to the end of the file.
                                                      filevar must refer to a file that has
                                                      been  opened for writing.
``read(n)``               ``filevar.read()``          Reads and returns a string of ``n``
                                                      characters, or the entire file as a
                                                      single string if  n is not provided.
``readline(n)``           ``filevar.readline()``      Returns the next line of the file with
                                                      all text up to and including the
                                                      newline character. If n is provided as
                                                      a parameter than only n characters
                                                      will be returned if the line is longer
                                                      than ``n``.
``readlines(n)``          ``filevar.readlines()``     Returns a list of strings, each
                                                      representing a single line of the file.
                                                      If n is not provided then all lines of
                                                      the file are returned. If n is provided
                                                      then n characters are read but n is
                                                      rounded up so that an entire line is
                                                      returned.
======================== =========================== =====================================


In this course, we will generally either iterate through the lines returned by ``readlines()`` with a for loop, 
or use ``read()`` to get all of the contents as a single string.

In other programming languages, where they don't have the convenient for loop method of going through the lines 
of the file one by one, they use a different pattern which requires a different kind of loop, the ``while`` loop. 
Fortunately, you don't need to learn this other pattern, and we will put off consideration of ``while`` loops 
until later in this course. We don't need them for handling data from files.

.. note::

   A common error that novice programmers make is not realizing that all these ways of reading the file contents, 
   **use up the file**. After you call readlines(), if you call it again you'll get an empty list.

    Writing essays for school can be difficult but
    many students find that by researching their topic that they
    have more to say and are better informed. Here are the university
    we require many undergraduate students to take a first year writing requirement
    so that they can
    have a solid foundation for their writing skills. This comes
    in handy for many students.
    Different schools have different requirements, but everyone uses
    writing at some point in their academic career, be it essays, research papers,
    technical write ups, or scripts.
