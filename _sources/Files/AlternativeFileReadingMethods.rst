Alternative File Reading Methods
--------------------------------

Once you have a file "object", the thing returned by the open function, Python provides three methods to read data
from that object. The ``read()`` method returns the entire contents of the file as a single string (or just some 
characters if you provide a number as an input parameter. The ``readlines`` method returns the entire contents of
the entire file as a list of strings, where each item in the list is one line of the file. The ``readline`` 
method reads one line from the file and returns it as a string. The strings returned by ``readlines`` or 
``readline`` will contain the newline character at the end.  :ref:`Table 2 <filemethods2a>` summarizes these 
methods and the following session shows them in action.

.. _filemethods2a:

======================== =========================== =====================================
**Method Name**           **Use**                     **Explanation**
======================== =========================== =====================================
``write``                 ``filevar.write(astring)``  Add astring to the end of the file.
                                                      filevar must refer to a file that has
                                                      been  opened for writing.
``read(n)``               ``filevar.read()``          Reads and returns a string of ``n``
                                                      characters, or the entire file as a
                                                      single string if  n is not provided.
``readline(n)``           ``filevar.readline()``      Returns the next line of the file with
                                                      all text up to and including the
                                                      newline character. If n is provided as
                                                      a parameter than only n characters
                                                      will be returned if the line is longer
                                                      than ``n``.
``readlines(n)``          ``filevar.readlines()``     Returns a list of strings, each
                                                      representing a single line of the file.
                                                      If n is not provided then all lines of
                                                      the file are returned. If n is provided
                                                      then n characters are read but n is
                                                      rounded up so that an entire line is
                                                      returned.
======================== =========================== =====================================


In this course, we will generally either iterate through the lines returned by ``readlines()`` with a for loop, 
or use ``read()`` to get all of the contents as a single string.

In other programming languages, where they don't have the convenient for loop method of going through the lines 
of the file one by one, they use a different pattern which requires a different kind of loop, the ``while`` loop. 
Fortunately, you don't need to learn this other pattern, and we will put off consideration of ``while`` loops 
until later in this course. We don't need them for handling data from files.

.. note::

   A common error that novice programmers make is not realizing that all these ways of reading the file contents, 
   **use up the file**. After you call readlines(), if you call it again you'll get an empty list.
