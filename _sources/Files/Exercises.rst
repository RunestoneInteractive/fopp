    This summer I will be travelling.
    I will go to...
    Italy: Rome

    Writing essays for school can be difficult but
    many students find that by researching their topic that they
    have more to say and are better informed. Here are the university
    we require many undergraduate students to take a first year writing requirement
    so that they can
    have a solid foundation for their writing skills. This comes
    in handy for many students.
    Different schools have different requirements, but everyone uses
    writing at some point in their academic career, be it essays, research papers,
    technical write ups, or scripts.

                The following sample file called ``studentdata.txt`` contains one line for each student in an imaginary class.  The
                students name is the first thing on each line, followed by some exam scores.
                The number of scores might be different for each student.

                .. raw:: html

                    <pre id="studentdata.txt">
                    joe 10 15 20 30 40
                    bill 23 16 19 22

                    john 14 32 25 16 89
                    </pre>

                Using the text file ``studentdata.txt`` write a program that prints out the names of
                students that have more than six quiz scores.
                ~~~~
                # Hint: first see if you can write a program that just prints out the number of scores on each line
                # Then, make it print the number only if the number is at least six
                # Then, switch it to printing the name instead of the number
