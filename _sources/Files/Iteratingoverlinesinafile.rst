Iterating over lines in a file
------------------------------

We will now use this file as input in a program that will do some data processing. In the program, we will 
examine each line of the file and print it with some additional text. Because ``readlines()`` returns a list of 
lines of text, we can use the *for* loop to iterate through each line of the file.

A **line** of a file is defined to be a sequence of characters up to and including a special character called 
the **newline** character. If you evaluate a string that contains a newline character you will see the character 
represented as ``\n``. If you print a string that contains a newline you will not see the ``\n``, you will just 
see its effects (a carriage return).

As the *for* loop iterates through each line of the file the loop variable will contain the current line of the 
file as a string of characters. The general pattern for processing each line of a text file is as follows:

::

        for line in myFile.readlines():
            statement1
            statement2
            ...

To process all of our olypmics data, we will use a *for* loop to iterate over the lines of the file. Using
the ``split`` method, we can break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest about the
athlete. We can then take the values corresponding to name, team and event to
construct a simple sentence.

.. activecode:: ac9_5_1

    olypmicsfile = open("olypmics.txt","r")

    for aline in olypmicsfile.readlines():
        values = aline.split(",")
        print(values[0], "is from", values[3], "and is on the roster for", values[4])

    olypmicsfile.close()

To make the code a little simpler, and to allow for more efficient processing, Python provides a built-in way to 
iterate through the contents of a file one line at a time, without first reading them all into a list. Some students find this confusing initially, so we don't recommend doing it this way, until you get a 
little more comfortable with Python. But this idiom is preferred by Python programmers, so you should be prepared 
to read it. And when you start dealing with big files, you may notice the efficiency gains of using it.

.. activecode:: ac9_5_2

    olypmicsfile = open("olypmics.txt","r")

    for aline in olypmicsfile:
        values = aline.split(",")
        print(values[0], "is from", values[3], "and is on the roster for", values[4])

    olypmicsfile.close()

   1. Write code to find out how many lines are in the file ``emotion_words.txt`` as shown above. Save this value to the variable ``num_lines``. Do not use the len method.
