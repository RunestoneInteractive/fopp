One more common pattern with lists, besides accumulation, is to step through a pair of lists (or several lists), doing 
something with all of the first items, then something with all of the second items, and so on. For example, given two 
lists of numbers, you might like to add them up pairwise, taking [3, 4, 5] and [1, 2, 3] to yield [4, 6, 8].

One way to do that with a for loop is to loop through the possible index values. 

.. activecode:: ac21_5_1

   L1 = [3, 4, 5]
   L2 = [1, 2, 3]
   L3 = []
   
   for i in range(len(L1)):
       L3.append(L1[i] + L2[i])
   
   print(L3)
      
You have seen this idea previously for iterating through the items in a single list. In many other programming languages 
that's really the only way to iterate through the items in a list. In Python, however, we have gotten used to the for loop 
where the iteration variable is bound successively to each item in the list, rather than just to a number that's used as a 
position or index into the list. 

Can't we do something similar with pairs of lists? It turns out we can.

The ``zip`` function takes multiple lists and turns them into a list of tuples (actually, an iterator, but they work like 
lists for most practical purposes), pairing up all the first items as one tuple, all the second items as a tuple, and so 
on. Then we can iterate through those tuples, and perform some operation on all the first items, all the second items, and 
so on.

.. activecode:: ac21_5_2

   L1 = [3, 4, 5]
   L2 = [1, 2, 3]
   L4 = list(zip(L1, L2))
   print(L4)

Here's what happens when you loop through the tuples.
   
.. activecode:: ac21_5_3

   L1 = [3, 4, 5]
   L2 = [1, 2, 3]
   L3 = []
   L4 = list(zip(L1, L2))

   for (x1, x2) in L4:
       L3.append(x1+x2)
   
   print(L3)

Or, simplifying and using a list comprehension:

.. activecode:: ac21_5_4

   L1 = [3, 4, 5]
   L2 = [1, 2, 3]
   L3 = [x1 + x2 for (x1, x2) in list(zip(L1, L2))]
   print(L3)
   
Or, using ``map`` and not unpacking the tuple (our online environment has trouble with unpacking the tuple in a lambda expression):

.. activecode:: ac21_5_5

   L1 = [3, 4, 5]
   L2 = [1, 2, 3]
   L3 = map(lambda x: x[0] + x[1], zip(L1, L2))
   print(L3)

Consider a function called possible, which determines whether a word is still possible to play in a game of hangman, given the guesses that have been made and the current state of the blanked word.

Below we provide function that fulfills that purpose.

.. activecode:: ac21_5_6

   def possible(word, blanked, guesses_made):
       if len(word) != len(blanked):
           return False
       for i in range(len(word)):
           bc = blanked[i]
           wc = word[i]
           if bc == '_' and wc in guesses_made:
               return False
           elif bc != '_' and bc != wc:
               return False
       return True
   
   print(possible("wonderwall", "_on__r__ll", "otnqurl"))
   print(possible("wonderwall", "_on__r__ll", "wotnqurl"))

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(possible("HELLO", "_ELL_", "ELJ"), True, "Testing whether possible has been correctly defined.")
         self.assertEqual(possible("HELLO", "_ELL_", "ELJH"), False, "Testing whether possible has been correctly defined.")
         self.assertEqual(possible("HELLO", "_E___", "ELJ"), False, "Testing whether possible has been correctly defined.")

   myTests().main()

However, we can rewrite that using ``zip``, to be a little more comprehensible.

.. activecode:: ac21_5_7

   def possible(word, blanked, guesses_made):
       if len(word) != len(blanked):
           return False
       for (bc, wc) in zip(blanked, word):
           if bc == '_' and wc in guesses_made:
               return False
           elif bc != '_' and bc != wc:
               return False
       return True

   print(possible("wonderwall", "_on__r__ll", "otnqurl"))
   print(possible("wonderwall", "_on__r__ll", "wotnqurl"))

         self.assertEqual(possible("HELLO", "_ELL_", "ELJH"), False, "Testing whether possible has been correctly defined.")
         self.assertEqual(possible("HELLO", "_E___", "ELJ"), False, "Testing whether possible has been correctly defined.")

   **1.** Below we have provided two lists of numbers, ``L1`` and ``L2``. Using zip and list comprehension, create a new list, ``L3``, that sums the two numbers if the number from ``L1`` is greater than 10 and the number from ``L2`` is less than 5. This can be accomplished in one line of code.

   L1 = [1, 5, 2, 16, 32, 3, 54, 8, 100]
   L2 = [1, 3, 10, 2, 42, 2, 3, 4, 3]
