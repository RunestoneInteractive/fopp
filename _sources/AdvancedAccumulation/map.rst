Map
---

You previously were introduced to accumulating a list by transforming each of the elements. Here we revisit that pattern.

The following function produces a new list with each item in the original list doubled. It is an example of a mapping, 
from the original list to a new list of the same length, where each element is doubled.

.. activecode:: ac21_2_1
    
    def doubleStuff(a_list):
        """ Return a new list in which contains doubles of the elements in a_list. """
        new_list = []
        for value in a_list:
            new_elem = 2 * value
            new_list.append(new_elem)
        return new_list
    
    things = [2, 5, 9]
    print(things)
    things = doubleStuff(things)
    print(things)

The doubleStuff function is an example of the accumulator pattern, in particular the mapping pattern. On line 3, 
``new_list`` is initialized. On line 5, the doubled value for the current item is produced and on line 6 it is appended to 
the list we're accumulating. Line 7 executes after we've processed all the items in the original list: it returns the 
``new_list``. Once again, codelens helps us to see the actual references and objects as they are passed and returned.

.. codelens:: clens21_2_1
    :python: py3

    def doubleStuff(a_list):
        """ Return a new list in which contains doubles of the elements in a_list. """
        new_list = []
        for value in a_list:
            new_elem = 2 * value
            new_list.append(new_elem)
        return new_list

    things = [2, 5, 9]
    things = doubleStuff(things)

This pattern of computation is so common that python offers a more general way to do mappings, the ``map`` function, that 
makes it more clear what the overall structure of the computation is. ``map`` takes two arguments, a function and a 
sequence. The function is the mapper that transforms items. It is automatically applied to each item in the sequence. You 
don't have to initialize an accumulator or iterate with a for loop at all.

.. note::

    Technically, in a proper Python 3 interpreter, the ``map`` function produces an "iterator", which is like a list but
    produces the items as they are needed. Most places in Python where you can use a list (e.g., in a for loop) you can
    use an "iterator" as if it was actually a list. So you probably won't ever notice the difference. If you ever really
    need a list, you can explicitly turn the output of map into a list: ``list(map(...))``. In the runestone environment, ``map`` actually returns a real list, but to make this code compatible with a full python environment, we always convert it to a list.

As we did when passing a function as a parameter to the ``sorted`` function, we can specify a function to pass to ``map`` 
either by referring to a function by name, or by providing a lambda expression.

.. activecode:: ac21_2_2

   def triple(value):
       return 3*value
      
   def tripleStuff(a_list):
       new_seq = map(triple, a_list)
       return list(new_seq)

   def quadrupleStuff(a_list):
       new_seq = map(lambda value: 4*value, a_list)
       return list(new_seq)
      
   things = [2, 5, 9]
   things3 = tripleStuff(things)
   print(things3)
   things4 = quadrupleStuff(things)
   print(things4)

Of course, once we get used to using the ``map`` function, it's no longer necessary to define functions like 
``tripleStuff`` and ``quadrupleStuff``.

.. activecode:: ac21_2_3

   things = [2, 5, 9]
   
   things4 = map((lambda value: 4*value), things)
   print(list(things4))
   
   # or all on one line
   print(list(map((lambda value: 5*value), [1, 2, 3])))
