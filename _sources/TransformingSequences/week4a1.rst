.. mchoice:: assess_question4_1_1_1
   :answer_a: I.
   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: Neither is the correct reference diagram.
   :feedback_a: Yes, when we are using the remove method, we are just editing the existing list, not making a new copy.
   :feedback_b: When we use the remove method, we just edit the existing list. We do not make a new copy that does not include the removed object. 
   :feedback_c: One of the diagrams is correct - look again at what is happening to lst.
   :correct: a
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/MutatingMethods

   Which of these is a correct reference diagram following the execution of the following code?

   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    lst = ['mercury', 'venus', 'earth', 'mars', 'jupiter', 'saturn', 'uranus', 'neptune', 'pluto']
    lst.remove('pluto')

   :answer_a: .pop()
   :answer_b: .insert()
   :answer_c: .count()
   :answer_d: .index()
   :feedback_a: pop removes and returns items (default is to remove and return the last item in the list) 
   :feedback_b: insert will add an item at whatever position is specified.
   :feedback_c: count returns the number of times something occurs in a list
   :feedback_d: Yes, index will return the position of the first occurance of an item.
   :correct: d
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/MutatingMethods

   Which method would you use to figure out the position of an item in a list?

.. mchoice:: assess_question4_1_1_3
   :answer_a: .insert()
   :answer_b: .pop()
   :answer_c: .append()
   :answer_d: .remove()
   :feedback_a: While you can use insert, it is not the best method to use because you need to specify that you want to stick the new item at the end.
   :feedback_b: pop removes an item from a list
   :feedback_c: Yes, though you can use insert to do the same thing, you don't need to provide the position.
   :feedback_d: remove gets rid of the first occurance of any item that it is told. It does not add an item.
   :correct: c

Chapter Assessment - Aliases and References
===========================================

**Check your understanding**

.. fillintheblank:: assess_question3_3_1_1
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/ObjectsandReferences

   What will be the value of ``a`` after the following code has executed?

   .. sourcecode:: python

    a = ["holiday", "celebrate!"]
    quiet = a
    quiet.append("company")


   The value of ``a`` will be

   -  :\[["']holiday["'], ["']celebrate!["'], ["']company["']\]: Good work!
      :\[["']holiday["'], ["']celebrate!["']\]: This is the old value of a - a has changed.
      :.*: Incorrect, try again. Don't forget to include a space between list elements.

.. mchoice:: assess_question3_3_1_2
   :answer_a: yes
   :answer_b: no
   :feedback_a: Yes, b and z reference the same list and changes are made using both aliases.
   :feedback_b: Can you figure out what the value of b is only by looking at the lines that mention b?
   :correct: a
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/Aliasing

   Could aliasing cause potential confusion in this problem?

   .. sourcecode:: python

    b = ['q', 'u', 'i']
    z = b
    b[1] = 'i'
    z.remove('i')
    print(z)

.. mchoice:: assess_question3_3_1_4
   :answer_a: yes
   :answer_b: no
   :feedback_a: Since a string is immutable, aliasing won't be as confusing. Beware of using something like item = item + new_item with mutable objects though because it creates a new object. However, when we use += then that doesn't happen.
   :feedback_b: Since a string is immutable, aliasing won't be as confusing. Beware of using something like item = item + new_item with mutable objects though because it creates a new object. However, when we use += then that doesn't happen.
   :correct: b
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/Aliasing

   Could aliasing cause potential confusion in this problem?

   .. sourcecode:: python

    sent = "Holidays can be a fun time when you have good company!"
    phrase = sent
    phrase = phrase + " Holidays can also be fun on your own!"

.. mchoice:: assess_question3_3_1_5
   :answer_a: I.
   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: III.
   :answer_d: IV.
   :feedback_a: When an object is concatenated with another using +=, it extends the original object. If this is done in the longer form (item = item + object) then it makes a copy.
   :feedback_b: When an object is concatenated with another using +=, it extends the original object. If this is done in the longer form (item = item + object) then it makes a copy.
   :feedback_c: When an object is concatenated with another using +=, it extends the original object. If this is done in the longer form (item = item + object) then it makes a copy.
   :feedback_d: Yes, the behavior of obj = obj + object_two is different than obj += object_two when obj is a list. The first version makes a new object entirely and reassigns to obj. The second version changes the original object so that the contents of object_two are added to the end of the first.
   :correct: d
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/ObjectsandReferences

   Which of these is a correct reference diagram following the execution of the following code?

===================================

.. mchoice:: assess_question4_1_3_1
   :answer_a: I.
   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: III.
   :answer_d: IV.
   :feedback_a: Yes, when we make our own diagrams we want to keep the old information because sometimes other variables depend on them. It can get cluttered though if there is a lot of information.
   :feedback_b: Not quite, we want to keep track of old information because sometimes other variables depend on them. 
   :feedback_c: Look again at what is happening when join is executed.
   :feedback_d: What happens to the spaces in a string when it is split by whitespace?
   :correct: a
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/MutatingMethods

   Which of these is a correct reference diagram following the execution of the following code?

   .. sourcecode:: python

Chapter Assessment - For Loop Mechanics
=======================================

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: assess_question5_1_1_1
   :answer_a: byzo
   :answer_b: x
   :answer_c: z
   :answer_d: c
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This is the variable with our string, but it does not accumulate anything.
   :feedback_b: This is the iterator variable. It changes each time but does not accumulate.
   :feedback_c: This is a variable inside the for loop. It changes each time but does not accumulate or retain the old expressions that were assigned to it.
   :feedback_d: Yes, this is the accumulator variable. By the end of the program, it will have a full count of how many items are in byzo.
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/TheAccumulatorPatternwithStrings

   Which of these is the accumulator variable?
   
   .. sourcecode:: python

    byzo = 'hello world!'
    c = 0
    for x in byzo:
        z = x + "!"
        print(z)
        c = c + 1

.. mchoice:: assess_question5_1_1_2
   :answer_a: cawdra
   :answer_b: elem
   :answer_c: t
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, this is the sequence that we iterate over.
   :feedback_b: This is the iterator variable. It changes each time but is not the whole sequence itself.
   :feedback_c: This is the accumulator variable. By the end of the program, it will have a full count of how many items are in cawdra.
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/TheAccumulatorPatternwithLists

   Which of these is the sequence?
   
   .. sourcecode:: python

    cawdra = ['candy', 'daisy', 'pear', 'peach', 'gem', 'crown']
    t = 0
    for elem in cawdra:
        t = t + len(elem)

.. mchoice:: assess_question5_1_1_3
   :answer_a: item
   :answer_b: lst
   :answer_c: num
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, this is the iterator variable. It changes each time but is not the whole sequence itself.
   :feedback_b: This is the sequence that we iterate over.
   :feedback_c: This is the accumulator variable. By the end of the program, it will have the total value of the integers that are in lst.
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/TheAccumulatorPatternwithLists

   Which of these is the iterator (loop) variable?
   
   .. sourcecode:: python

    lst = [5, 10, 3, 8, 94, 2, 4, 9]
    num = 0
    for item in lst:
        num += item

.. fillintheblank:: assess_question5_1_1_4
   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/TheAccumulatorPatternwithLists

   What is the iterator (loop) variable in the following?

   .. sourcecode:: python

    rest = ["sleep", 'dormir', 'dormire', "slaap", 'sen', 'yuxu', 'yanam']
    let = ''
    for phrase in rest:
        let += phrase[0]

   The iterator variable is

   -  :phrase: Good work!
      :rest: rest is the sequence, not the iterator variable.
      :let: let is the accumulator variable, not the iterator variable.
      :.*: Incorrect, try again.

.. activecode:: assess_week5_01

   :practice: T
   :topics: TransformingSequences/TheAccumulatorPatternwithStrings

   Currently there is a string called ``str1``. Write code to create a list called ``chars`` which should contain the characters from ``str1``. Each character in ``str1`` should be its own element in the list ``chars``.
   ~~~~
   str1 = "I love python"
   # HINT: what's the accumulator? That should go here.
      
   =====

   :answer_a: I.
   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: III.
   :answer_d: none of the above would be appropriate for the problem.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This pattern will only count how many items are in the list, not provide the total accumulated value.
   :feedback_b: This would reset the value of s each time the for loop iterated, and so by the end s would be assigned the value of the last item in the list plus the last item in the list.
   :feedback_c: Yes, this will solve the problem.
   :feedback_d: One of the patterns above is a correct way to solve the problem.

   :feedback_a: How does this solution know that the element of lst is a string and that s should be updated?
   :feedback_b: What happens to s each time the for loop iterates?
   :feedback_c: Reread the prompt again, what do we want to accumulate?
   :feedback_d: Yes, this will solve the problem.

   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: c,d
   :feedback_a: No, though sum might be clear, it is also the name of a commonly used function in Python, and so there can be issues if sum is used as an accumulator variable.
   :feedback_b: No, x is not a clear enough name to be used for an accumulator variable.
   :feedback_c: Yes, total is a good name for accumulating numbers.

   :feedback_c: Yes, elem can be a good name to use as an iterator variable, especially when iterating over lists.
   :feedback_d: Yes, char can be a good name to use when iterating over a string, because the iterator variable would be assigned a character each time.
   :feedback_e: At least one of the answers above is a good name for an iterator variable.

   :feedback_b: Though total is great and lst is an acceptable name, s is a little bit cryptic as a variable name referring to a sentence.
   :feedback_c: Though sentence_lst is a good name, the iterator variable should be singular rather than plural, and x is not an informative name for the accumulator variable.

   Write code that uses the string stored in ``org`` and creates an acronym which is assigned to the variable ``acro``. Only the first letter of each word should be used, each letter in the acronym should be a capital letter, and there should be nothing to separate the letters of the acronym. Words that should not be included in the acronym are stored in the list ``stopwords``. For example, if ``org`` was assigned the string "hello to world" then the resulting acronym should be "HW".

   Write code that uses the string stored in ``sent`` and creates an acronym which is assigned to the variable ``acro``. The first two letters of each word should be used, each letter in the acronym should be a capital letter, and each element of the acronym should be separated by a ". ". Words that should not be included in the acronym are stored in the list ``stopwords``. For example, if ``sent`` was assigned the string "height and ewok wonder" then the resulting acronym should be "HE. EW. WO".

   A palindrome is a phrase that, if reversed, would read the exact same. Write code that checks if ``p_phrase`` is a palindrome by reversing it and then checking if the reversed version is equal to the original. Assign the reversed version of ``p_phrase`` to the variable ``r_phrase`` so that we can check your work.

   Provided is a list of data about a store's inventory where each item in the list represents the name of an item, how much is in stock, and how much it costs. Print out each item in the list with the same formatting, using the .format method (not string concatenation). For example, the first print statment should read ``The store has 12 shoes, each for 29.99 USD.``
