    .. tab:: Question

        .. actex:: ac18_8_1

            You're going to write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns a list of the five most frequent characters in the string. Eventually, you will be able to do this sort of problem without a lot of coaching. But we're going to step you through it as a series of exercises.

            First, the function will count the frequencies of all the characters, as we've done before, using a dictionary and the accumulator pattern. Then, it will sort the (key, value) pairs. Finally, it will take a slice of the sorted list to get just the top five. That slice will be returned.

            Step 1. Suppose you had this list, [8, 7, 6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 1, 0], already sorted, how would you make a list of just the best 5? (Hint: take a slice).
            ~~~~

            L = [8, 7, 6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 1, 0]

             L = [8, 7, 6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 1, 0]
             L[:5]

    .. tab:: Question

        .. actex:: ac18_8_2

            Now suppose the list wasn't sorted yet. How would get those same five elements from this list?
            ~~~~
            L = [0, 1, 6, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 4]

            L = [0, 1, 6, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 4]
            L2 = sorted(L, reverse=True)
            L2[:5]


.. tabbed:: q3

    .. tab:: Question

        .. actex:: ac18_8_3

            Now take a list L and make a dictionary of counts for how often these numbers appear in the list.
            ~~~~

            L = [0, 1, 6, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 1, 6, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 35, 4, 11]

            L = [0, 1, 6, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 1, 6, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 35, 4, 11]
            d = {}
            for x in L:
                if x in d:
                    d[x] = d[x] + 1
                else:
                    d[x] = 1


.. tabbed:: q4

    .. tab:: Question

        .. actex:: ac18_8_4

            Now sort the keys (numbers) based on their frequencies. Review *Sorting a Dictionary* if you're not sure how to do this. Keep just the top five keys.

            L = [0, 1, 6, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 1, 6, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 35, 4, 11]

            d = {}
            for x in L:
                if x in d:

    .. tab:: Question

        .. actex:: ac18_8_5

           Finally, generalize what you've done. Write a function that takes a string instead of a list as a parameter and returns a list of the five most frequent characters in the string.

    .. tab:: Answer

        .. actex:: answer16_8_5

            def five_most_frequent(s):
                d = {}
                for x in s:
                    if x in d:
                        d[x] = d[x] + 1
                    else:
                        d[x] = 1

                s = sorted(d, key=lambda x: d[x], reverse=True)

                return s[:5]
