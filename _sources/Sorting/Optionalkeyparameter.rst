Optional key parameter
----------------------

If you want to sort things in some order other than the "natural" or its reverse, you can provide an
additional parameter, the key parameter. For example, suppose you want to sort a list of numbers based on
their absolute value, so that -4 comes after 3? Or suppose you have a dictionary with strings as the keys
and numbers as the values. Instead of sorting them in alphabetic order based on the keys, you might like
to sort them in order based on their values.

First, let's see an example, and then we'll dive into how it works.

First, let's define a function absolute that takes a number and returns its absolute value.
(Actually, python provides a built-in function ``abs`` that does this, but we are going to
define our own, for reasons that will be explained in a minute.)

.. activecode:: ac18_3_1

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]

    def absolute(x):
        if x >= 0:
            return x
        else:
            return -x

    print(absolute(3))
    print(absolute(-119))

    for y in L1:
        print(absolute(y))


Now, we can pass the absolute function to L1 in order to specify that we want the items
sorted in order of their absolute value, rather than in order of their actual value.

.. activecode:: ac18_3_2

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]

    def absolute(x):
        if x >= 0:
            return x
        else:
            return -x

    L2 = sorted(L1, key=absolute)
    print(L2)

    #or in reverse order
    print(sorted(L1, reverse=True, key=absolute))

What's really going on there? We've done something pretty strange. Before, all the values we have
passed as parameters have been pretty easy to understand: numbers, strings, lists, Booleans, dictionaries.
Here we have passed a function object: absolute is a variable name whose value is the function. When we
pass that function object, it is *not* automatically invoked. Instead, it is just bound to the formal
parameter key of the function sorted.

We are not going to look at the source code for the built-in function sorted. But if we did, we would find
somewhere in its code a parameter named key with a default value of None. When a value is provided for that
parameter in an invocation of the function sorted, it has to be a function. What the sorted function does is
call that key function once for each item in the list that's getting sorted. It associates the result returned
by that function (the absolute function in our case) with the original value. Think of those associated values
as being little post-it notes that decorate the original values. The value 4 has a post-it note that says 4
on it, but the value -2 has a post-it note that says 2 on it. Then the sorted function rearranges the original
items in order of the values written on their associated post-it notes.

To illustrate that the absolute function is invoked once on each item, during the execution of sorted, I have
added some print statements into the code.

.. activecode:: ac18_3_3

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]

    def absolute(x):
        print("--- figuring out what to write on the post-it note for " + str(x))
        if x >= 0:
            return x
        else:
            return -x

    print("About to call sorted")
    L2 = sorted(L1, key=absolute)
    print("Finished execution of sorted")
    print(L2)

Note that this code never explicitly calls the absolute function at all. It passes the absolute function as a parameter
value to the sorted function. Inside the sorted function, whose code we haven't seen, that function gets invoked.

.. note::

   It is a little confusing that we are reusing the word *key* so many times. The name of the optional parameter is
   ``key``. We will usually pass a parameter value using the keyword parameter passing mechanism. When we write
   ``key=some_function`` in the function invocation, the word key is there because it is the name of the parameter,
   specified in the definition of the sort function, not because we are using keyword-based parameter passing.

   **1.** You will be sorting the following list by each element's second letter a to z. Create a function to use when sorting that takes a string as input and return the second letter of that string and name it ``second_let``. Create a variable called ``func_sort`` and assign the sorted list to it. Do not use lambda.

   ex_lst = ['hi', 'how are you', 'bye', 'apple', 'zebra', 'dance']

   **2.** Below, we have provided a list of strings called ``nums``. Write a function called ``last_char`` that takes a string as input, and returns only its last character. Use this function to sort the list ``nums`` by the last digit of each number, from highest to lowest, and save this as a new list called ``nums_sorted``.

   nums = ['1450', '33', '871', '19', '14378', '32', '1005', '44', '8907', '16']

   **3.** Once again, sort the list ``nums`` based on the last digit of each number from highest to lowest. However, now you should do so by writing a lambda function. Save the new list as ``nums_sorted_lambda``.
