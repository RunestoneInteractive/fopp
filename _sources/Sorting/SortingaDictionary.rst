Sorting a Dictionary
--------------------

Previously, you have used a dictionary to accumulate counts, such as the frequencies of letters or words in a text.
For example, the following code counts the frequencies of different numbers in the list.

.. activecode:: ac18_4_1

    L = ['E', 'F', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'I', 'I', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'D']

    d = {}
    for x in L:
        if x in d:
            d[x] = d[x] + 1
        else:
            d[x] = 1
    for x in d.keys():
        print("{} appears {} times".format(x, d[x]))

The dictionary's keys are not sorted in any particular order. In fact, you may get a different order of output than 
someone else running the same code. We can force the results to be displayed in some fixed ordering, by sorting the keys.

.. activecode:: ac18_4_2

    L = ['E', 'F', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'I', 'I', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'D']

    d = {}
    for x in L:
        if x in d:
            d[x] = d[x] + 1
        else:
            d[x] = 1
    y = sorted(d.keys())
    for k in y:
        print("{} appears {} times".format(k, d[k]))


With a dictionary that's maintaining counts or some other kind of score, we might prefer to get the outputs sorted based 
on the count rather than based on the items. The standard way to do that in python is to sort based on a property of the key, in particular its value in the dictionary.

Here things get a little confusing because we have two different meaning of the word "key". One meaning is a key in a dictionary. The other meaning is the parameter name for the function that you pass into the sorted function.

Remember that the key function always takes as input one item from the sequence and returns a property of the item. In our case, the items to be sorted are the dictionary's keys, so each item is one key from the dictionary. To remind ourselves of that, we've named the parameter in tha lambda expression *k*. The property of key k that is supposed to be returned is its associated value in the dictionary. Hence, we have the lambda expression ``lambda k: d[k]``.

.. activecode:: ac18_4_5

    L = ['E', 'F', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'I', 'I', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'D']
    
    d = {}
    for x in L:
        if x in d:
            d[x] = d[x] + 1
        else:
            d[x] = 1
    
    y = sorted(d.keys(), key=lambda k: d[k], reverse=True)
    for k in y:
        print("{} appears {} times".format(k, d[k]))

Here's a version of that using a named function.

.. activecode:: ac18_4_6

    L = ['E', 'F', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'I', 'I', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'D']

    d = {}
    for x in L:
        if x in d:
            d[x] = d[x] + 1
        else:
            d[x] = 1
    
    def g(k):
        return d[k]

    y =(sorted(d.keys(), key=g, reverse=True))
    
    # now loop through the keys
    for k in y:
        print("{} appears {} times".format(x, d[x]))

.. note::

   When we sort the keys, passing a function with ``key=lambda x: d[x]`` does not specify to sort the keys of a
   dictionary. The lists of keys are passed as the first parameter value in the invocation of sort. The key parameter 
   provides a function that says *how* to sort them.


An experienced programmer would probably not even separate out the sorting step. And
they might take advantage of the fact that when you pass a dictionary to something
that is expecting a list, its the same as passing the list of keys.

.. activecode:: ac18_4_7

  L = ['E', 'F', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'I', 'I', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'D']

  d = {}
  for x in L:
      if x in d:
          d[x] = d[x] + 1
      else:
          d[x] = 1
      
  # now loop through the sorted keys
  for k in sorted(d, key=lambda k: d[k], reverse=True):
        print("{} appears {} times".format(k, d[k]))

Eventually, you will be able to read code like that and immediately know what it's doing. For now, when you come 
across something confusing, like line 11, try breaking it down. The function ``sorted`` is invoked. Its first parameter 
value is a dictionary, which really means the keys of the dictionary. The third parameter, the key function, decorates 
the dictionary key with a post-it note containing that key's value in dictionary d. The last parameter, True, says to 
sort in reverse order.

There is another way to sort dictionaries, by calling .items() to extract a sequence of (key, value) tuples, and then sorting that sequence of tuples. But it's better to learn the pythonic way of doing it, sorting the dictionary keys using a key function that takes one key as input and looks up the value in the dictionary.
