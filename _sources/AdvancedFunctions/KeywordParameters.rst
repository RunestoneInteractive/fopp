Keyword Parameters
==================

In the previous section, on :ref:`Optional Parameters <optional_params_chap>` you learned how to define default values
for formal parameters, which made it optional to provide values for those parameters when invoking the functions.

In this chapter, you'll see one more way to invoke functions with optional parameters, with keyword-based parameter
passing. This is particularly convenient when there are several optional parameters and you want to provide a value for
one of the later parameters while not providing a value for the earlier ones.

The online official python documentation includes a tutorial on optional
parameters which covers the topic quite well. Please read the content
there: `Keyword arguments <http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments>`_

Don't worry about the ``def cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):`` example. You should be able to get by without
understanding ``*parameters`` and ``**parameters`` in this course. But do make sure you understand the stuff above that.

The basic idea of passing arguments by keyword is very simple. When invoking a function, inside the parentheses there
are always 0 or more values, separated by commas. With keyword arguments, some of the values can be of the form
``paramname = <expr>`` instead of just ``<expr>``. Note that when you have ``paramname = <expr>`` in a function
definition, it is defining the default value for a parameter when no value is provided in the invocation; when you have
``paramname = <expr>`` in the invocation, it is supplying a value, overriding the default for that paramname.

To make it easier to follow the details of the examples in the official python tutorial, you can step through them in CodeLens.

.. codelens:: keyword_params_1
   :python: py3

   def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom', type='Norwegian Blue'):
       print("-- This parrot wouldn't" + action,)
       print("if you put" + str(voltage) + "volts through it.")
       print("-- Lovely plumage, the" +  type)
       print("-- It's " + state + "!")

   parrot(1000)                                          # 1 positional argument
   parrot(voltage=1000)                                  # 1 keyword argument
   parrot(voltage=1000000, action='VOOOOOM')             # 2 keyword arguments
   parrot(action='VOOOOOM', voltage=1000000)             # 2 keyword arguments
   parrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')         # 3 positional arguments
   parrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')  # 1 positional, 1 keyword

As you step through it, each time the function is invoked, make a prediction about what each of the four parameter
values will be during execution of lines 2-5. Then, look at the stack frame to see what they actually are during the
execution.

.. note::

   Note that we have yet another, slightly different use of the = sign here. As a stand-alone, top-level statement,
   ``x=3``, the variable x is set to 3. Inside the parentheses that invoke a function, ``x=3`` says that 3 should be
   bound to the local variable x in the stack frame for the function invocation. Inside the parentheses of a function
   definition, ``x=3`` says that 3 should be the value for x in every invocation of the function where no value is
   explicitly provided for x.


Keyword Parameters with .format
-------------------------------

Earlier you learned how to use the ``format`` method for strings, which allows you to structure strings like
fill-in-the-blank sentences. Now that you've learned about optional and keyword parameters, we can introduce a new way to
use the ``format`` method.

This other option is to specifically refer to keywords for interpolation values, like below.

.. activecode:: ac15_2_1

   names_scores = [("Jack",[67,89,91]),("Emily",[72,95,42]),("Taylor",[83,92,86])]
   for name, scores in names_scores:
       print("The scores {nm} got were: {s1},{s2},{s3}.".format(nm=name,s1=scores[0],s2=scores[1],s3=scores[2]))


Sometimes, you may want to use the ``.format`` method to insert the same value into a string
multiple times. You can do this by simply passing the same string into the format method,
assuming you have included ``{}`` s in the string everywhere you want to interpolate them. But
you can also use positional passing references to do this! The order in which you pass
arguments into the ``format`` method matters: the first one is argument ``0``, the second is
argument ``1``, and so on.

For example,

.. activecode:: ac15_2_2

   # this works
   names = ["Jack","Jill","Mary"]
   for n in names:
       print("'{}!' she yelled. '{}! {}, {}!'".format(n,n,n,"say hello"))

   # but this also works!
   names = ["Jack","Jill","Mary"]
   for n in names:
       print("'{0}!' she yelled. '{0}! {0}, {1}!'".format(n,"say hello"))

   :feedback_e: z has a default value in the function definition, so it's optional to pass a value for it.

   What value will be printed for z?

   .. code-block:: python

   :feedback_c: say what?
   :feedback_d: 10 is the second value passed, but it is bound to z, not y.
   :feedback_e: That's the beauty of passing parameters with keywords; you can skip some parameters and they get their default values.
   :practice: T

   What value will be printed for y?

   .. code-block:: python

      initial = 7
      def f(x, y = 3, z = initial):

   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: 2 is bound to x since it's the first value, but so is 5, based on keyword.
   :feedback_b:
   :feedback_c: 5 is bound to x by keyword, but 2 is also bound to it by virtue of being the value and not having a keyword. In the online environment, it actually allows this, but not in a proper python interpreter.

   :feedback_e: 2 is bound to x since it's the first value, but so is 5, based on keyword.

   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: 2 is bound to x, no z
   :feedback_b: the default value for z is determined at the time the function is defined; at that time initial has the value 7.
   :feedback_c: the default value for z is determined at the time the function is defined, not when it is invoked.
   :feedback_d: there's nothing wrong with reassigning the value of a variable at a later time.

   What value will be printed for z?

   :answer_c: 'Catalina!' she yelled. 'Come here, Catalina! Alexey, Misuki, and Pablo are here!'
   :answer_d: There is an error. You cannot repeatedly use the keyword parameters.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Remember, the values inside of {} are variable names. The values of the variables will be used.
   :feedback_b: Look again at what value is set to the variable first.
   :feedback_c: Yes, the keyword parameters will determine the order of the strings.

   **5.** Define a function called ``multiply``. It should have one required parameter, a string. It should also have one optional parameter, an integer, named ``mult_int``, with a default value of 10. The function should return the string multiplied by the integer. (i.e.: Given inputs "Hello", mult_int=3, the function should return "HelloHelloHello")

         self.assertEqual(multiply("Hello", mult_int = 3), "HelloHelloHello", "Testing the function multiply on inputs 'Hello', 3.")
         self.assertEqual(multiply("Goodbye"), "GoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbye", "Testing the function mulitply on input 'Goodbye'.")

   **6.** Currently the function is supposed to take 1 required parameter, and 2 optional parameters, however the code doesn't work because a parameter name without a default value follows a parameter name with a default value. Fix the code so that it passes the test. This should only require changing one line of code.
