Introduction: The Way of the Program
====================================

The goal of this book is to teach you to understand and create computer programs in Python.
You will use that ability to shed light on how people and computers are alike
and different as processors of information. This book provides
a human-centric view of computer programming.

Understanding computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking.
Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed,
they transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and 
very fast, but not creatively. Computers do what you tell them to do, not you
mean for them to do. Understanding computer code, and especially debugging it,
involves a lot of mental simulation of what will actually happen, not what you 
wish would happen. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of 
mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, programmers
use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, 
they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs 
among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, 
form hypotheses, and test predictions.
 
Writing computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative
problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think
creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As
it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to
practice problem solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, *The Way of
the Program*.

On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On
another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along,
that end will become clearer.
