Glossary

.. glossary::

    activecode
        A unique interpreter environment that allows Python to be executed from within a web browser.

    algorithm
        A step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.

    bug
        An error in a program.

    byte code
        An intermediate language between source code and object code. Many
        modern languages first compile source code into byte code and then
        interpret the byte code with a program called a *virtual machine*.

    codelens
        An interactive environment that allows the user to control the step by step execution of a Python program

    comment
        Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone
        reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the
        program.

    compile
        To translate a program written in a high-level language into a
        low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.

    debugging
        The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of
        programming errors: ***syntax error***, ***semantic error***, and ***runtime error***. 

    exception
        Another name for a runtime error.

    executable
        Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.

    formal language
        Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific
        purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs;
        all programming languages are formal languages.

    high-level language
        A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for
        humans to read and write.

    interpret
        To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one
        line at a time.

    low-level language
        A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to
        execute; also called machine language or assembly language.

    natural language
        Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.

    object code
        The output of the compiler after it translates the program.

    parse
        To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

    portability
        A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer.

    print function
        A function used in a program or script that causes the Python
        interpreter to display a value on its output device.

    problem solving
        The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and
        expressing the solution.

    program
        A sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and
        computations to be performed.

    programming language
         A vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.

    Python shell
        An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter, and the user of a
        Python shell types commands at the prompt (>>>), and presses the return
        key to send these commands immediately to the interpreter for
        processing. To initiate the Python Shell, the user should open theterminal and type "python". Once the user presses           enter, the Python Shell appears and the user can interact with it. 

    runtime error
        An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute
        but that prevents the program from continuing.

    semantic error
        An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the
        programmer intended.

    semantics
        The meaning of a program.

    shell mode
        A mode of using Python where expressions can be typed and executed in the command
        prompt, and the results are shown immediately in the command terminal window. Shell mode is initiated by opening the           terminal of your operating system and typing "python". Press enter and the Python Shell will appear. This is in               contrast to **source code**. Also see the entry under **Python shell**.

    source code
        The instructions in a program, stored in a file, in a high-level language before being compiled or interpreted.

    syntax
        The structure of a program.

    syntax error
        An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse --- and
        therefore impossible to interpret.

    token
        One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program,
        analogous to a word in a natural language.
