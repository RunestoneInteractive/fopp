Chapter Assessment
------------------

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: assess_question1_1_1
   :answer_a: Because computers are better at solving problems.
   :answer_b: So that you don't have to solve the problem yourself.
   :answer_c: So that you have a general solution to a problem.
   :answer_d: Because you need a set of instructions to follow.
   :feedback_a: Computers aren't necessarily better at solving problems, though often they can be quicker than humans. Additionally, algorithms can be used to solve non-computer related problems.
   :feedback_b: While it is beneficial to have a set of instructions that others can follow, this isn't the best answer. By creating the algorithm, you solve a problem for yourself and others.
   :feedback_c: Yes, by creating a general solution you can then express it as a program if you choose, and then use a computer to automate the execution.
   :feedback_d: While it is beneficial to have a set of instructions as that is what an algorithm **is**, it is not **why** we would want to create one.

   Why create an algorithm?

.. activecode:: assess_question1_1_2
    :language: python
    :autograde: unittest

    Write code to print out the phrase "Hello World".
    ~~~~

    ====

    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
            self.assertIn("Hello World", self.getOutput(), "Your output should contain a phrase Hello World")

    myTests().main()
