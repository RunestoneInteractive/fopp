   Define a class called ``Bike`` that accepts a string and a float as input, and assigns those inputs respectively to two instance variables, ``color`` and ``price``. Assign to the variable ``testOne`` an instance of ``Bike`` whose color is **blue** and whose price is **89.99**. Assign to the variable ``testTwo`` an instance of Bike whose color is **purple** and whose price is **25.0**.

   Create a class called ``AppleBasket`` whose constructor accepts two inputs: a string representing a color, and a number representing a quantity of apples. The constructor should initialize two instance variables: ``apple_color`` and ``apple_quantity``.  Write a class method called ``increase`` that increases the quantity by ``1`` each time it is invoked. You should also write a ``__str__`` method for this class that returns a string of the format: ``"A basket of [quantity goes here] [color goes here] apples."`` e.g. ``"A basket of 4 red apples."`` or ``"A basket of 50 blue apples."`` (Writing some test code that creates instances and assigns values to variables may help you solve this problem!)

   Define a class called ``BankAccount`` that accepts the name you want associated with your bank account in a string, and an integer that represents the amount of money in the account. The constructor should initialize two instance variables from those inputs: ``name`` and ``amt``. Add a string method so that when you print an instance of ``BankAccount``, you see ``"Your account, [name goes here], has [start_amt goes here] dollars."`` Create an instance of this class with ``"Bob"`` as the name and ``100`` as the amount. Save this to the variable ``t1``.
