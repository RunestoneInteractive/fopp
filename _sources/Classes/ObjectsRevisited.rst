Objects Revisited
-----------------

In Python, every value is actually an object. Whether it be a dictionary, a list, or even an integer, they are all 
objects. Programs manipulate those objects either by performing computation with them or by asking them to perform 
methods. To be more specific, we say that an object has a **state** and a collection of **methods** that it can perform. 
(More about **methods** below.) The state of an object represents those things that the object knows about itself. The 
state is stored in **instance variables**. For example, each list has state, the items in the list. And it has methods, 
such as append and pop, which can operate on the list to change its state or do something else useful.
