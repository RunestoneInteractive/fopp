Converting an Object to a String
--------------------------------


When we're working with classes and objects, it is often necessary to print an object (that is, to print the state of an object).
Consider the example below.

.. activecode:: chp13_classesstr1

    class Point:
        """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """

        def __init__(self, initX, initY):

            self.x = initX
            self.y = initY

        def getX(self):
            return self.x

        def getY(self):
            return self.y

        def distanceFromOrigin(self):
            return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5


    p = Point(7,6)
    print(p)

The ``print`` function shown above produces a string representation of the Point ``p``.  The default functionality provided by
Python tells you that ``p`` is an object of type ``Point``.  However, it does not tell you anything about the specific
state of the point.

We can improve on this representation if we include a special method call ``__str__``.  Notice that this method uses the same naming convention as the constructor, that is two underscores before and after the name.  It is common that Python
uses this naming technique for special methods.

The ``__str__`` method is responsible for returning a string representation as defined by the class creator.  In other words, you as the programmer, get to choose what a ``Point`` should look like when it gets printed.  In this case, we
have decided that the string representation will include the values of x and y as well as some identifying text.  It
is required that the ``__str__`` method create and *return* a string.

Whatever string the ``__str__`` method for a class returns, that is the string that will print when you put any instance of that class in a print statement. For that reason, the string that a class's ``__str__`` method returns should usually include values of instance variables. If a point has ``x`` value 3 and ``y`` value 4, but another point has ``x`` value 5 and ``y`` value 9, those two Point objects should probably look different when you print them, right?

Take a look at the code below.

.. activecode:: chp13_classesstr2

    class Point:
        """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """

        def __init__(self, initX, initY):

            self.x = initX
            self.y = initY

        def getX(self):
            return self.x

        def getY(self):
            return self.y

        def distanceFromOrigin(self):
            return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5

        def __str__(self):
            return "x = {}, y = {}".format(self.x, self.y)

    p = Point(7,6)
    print(p)


When we run the program above you can see that the ``print`` function now shows the string that we chose.

Now, you ask, don't we already have a ``str`` type converter that can
turn our object into a string?  Yes we do!

And doesn't ``print``
automatically use this when printing things?  Yes again!

However, as we saw earlier, these automatic mechanisms do not do exactly what we want.  Python provides many default implementations for
methods that we as programmers will probably want to change.  When a programmer changes the meaning of a method we
say that we **override** the method.  Note also that the ``str`` type converter function uses whatever ``__str__`` method we
provide.


**Check Your Understanding**

1. Create a class called Cereal that accepts three inputs: 2 strings and 1 integer, and assigns them to 3 instance variables in the constructor: ``name``, ``brand``, and ``fiber``. When an instance of ``Cereal`` is printed, the user should see the following: "[name] cereal is produced by [brand] and has [fiber integer] grams of fiber in every serving!" To the variable name ``c1``, assign an instance of ``Cereal`` whose name is ``"Corn Flakes"``, brand is ``"Kellogg's"``, and fiber is ``2``. To the variable name ``c2``, assign an instance of ``Cereal`` whose name is ``"Honey Nut Cheerios"``, brand is ``"General Mills"``, and fiber is ``3``. Practice printing both!

      def testTwo(self):
         self.assertEqual(c2.__str__(), "Honey Nut Cheerios cereal is produced by General Mills and has 3 grams of fiber in every serving!", "Testing that c2 prints correctly.")
