Objects as Arguments and Parameters
-----------------------------------

You can pass an object as an argument to a function, in the usual way.

Here is a simple function called ``distance`` involving our new ``Point`` objects. The job of this function is to figure 
out the distance between two points.
 
.. activecode:: ac18_6_1

    import math
    
    class Point:
        """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """
        
        def __init__(self, initX, initY):
            """ Create a new point at the given coordinates. """
            self.x = initX
            self.y = initY

        def getX(self):
            return self.x

        def getY(self):
            return self.y

        def distanceFromOrigin(self):
            return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5

    def distance(point1, point2):
        xdiff = point2.getX() - point1.getX()
        ydiff = point2.getY() - point1.getY()

        dist = math.sqrt(xdiff**2 + ydiff**2)
        return dist
    
    p = Point(4,3)
    q = Point(0,0)
    print(distance(p,q))


``distance`` takes two points and returns the distance between them. Note that ``distance`` is **not** a method of the 
Point class. You can see this by looking at the indentation pattern. It is not inside the class definition. The other way 
we can know that ``distance`` is not a method of Point is that ``self`` is not included as a formal parameter. In 
addition, we do not invoke ``distance`` using the dot notation.

We *could have* made distance be a method of the Point class. Then, we would have called the first parameter self, and 
would have invoked it using the dot notation, as in the following code. Which way to implement it is a matter of coding 
style. Both work correctly. Most programmers choose whether to make functions be stand-alone or methods of a class based 
on whether the function semantically seems to be an operation that is performed on instances of the class. In this case, 
because distance is really a property of a pair of points and is symmetric (the distance from a to b is the same as that 
from b to a) it makes more sense to have it be a standalone function and not a method. Many heated discussions have 
occurred between programmers about such style decisions.
