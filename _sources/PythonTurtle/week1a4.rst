    **9.** Write a program that uses the turtle module to draw something. It doesn't have to be complicated, but draw something different than we have done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting ``.speed(10)`` for the turtle to draw fast, or ``.speed(0)`` for it to draw super fast with no animation.)
