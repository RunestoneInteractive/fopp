Repetition with a For Loop
--------------------------

Some of the programs we've seen so far are a bit tedious to type. If we want to make a 
repetitive pattern in our drawings, then it can take many lines of code. Thankfully, Python 
has a few ways for making this kind of task easier. For now you'll get a brief preview of a helpful control structure and function in Python which you will learn about later.

The control structure is called a for loop. If you've learned other programming languages 
then you may be familiar with what it does but the structure may be new. A for loop allows 
Python to execute a program in a non-linear fashion. Instead of evaluating the code line by line until it reaches the end, once the program reaches a for loop, it will tell the program to execute a set of lines for n number of times. Once the program has executed the code insde of the for loop n number of times, the program will then continue to evaluate and execute whatever is below the for loop. 

This is where the ``range`` function comes into play. Using the ``range`` function, you can 
specify how many times the contents inside of the for loop will execute. Here is a simple 
demonstration below of how this will work.

.. activecode:: ac3_5_1

   print("This will execute first")

   for _ in range(3):
       print("This line will execute three times")
       print("This line will also execute three times")

   print("Now we are outside of the for loop!")

There are a few things to notice here for when you use this later on. First, is that the two print statements on line 4 and 5 are executed three times, but we don't print line 4 
three times and then print line 5 three times. Instead, we print line 4, then line 5. Once 
that is done the for loop iterates, or brings the program back to the beginning of the for 
loop, and continues to print out lines 4 and 5 again until it has printed them both a total 
of three times. 

Second, these lines were printed the same number as is inside the ``range`` function. If we 
wanted to print them more or fewer times, then we would just need to change the number 
inside of the parentheses on line 3. 

Finally, the whitespace is important here. All of the statements that were printed out 
multiple times were indented under the for loop. Once we stopped indenting those lines, 
then the program was outside of the for loop and it would continue to execute linearly. If 
you'd like to watch the execution, checkout the code above in codelens!

Now it's time to combine this with the Turtle module. We can do a lot of cool stuff if we combine these two things! Below is code to do just that. Try to predict what the program will do before running it.

.. activecode:: ac3_5_2

   import turtle
   wn = turtle.Screen()
   
   elan = turtle.Turtle()

   distance = 50
   for _ in range(10):
       elan.forward(distance)
       elan.right(90)
       distance = distance + 10

.. note::

    Try it out yourself in the space below. What can you make?

    .. activecode:: ac3_5_3

       import turtle
       wn = turtle.Screen()
