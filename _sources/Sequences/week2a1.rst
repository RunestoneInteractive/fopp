.. mchoice:: assess_question2_1_1_1
   :answer_a: zpzpzpzpzp
   :answer_b: zzzzzppppp
   :answer_c: pzpzpzpzpz
   :answer_d: pppppzzzzz
   :answer_e: None of the above, an error will occur.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The order of concatenation matters.
   :feedback_b: Think about the order that the program is executed in, what occurs first?
   :feedback_c: Yes, because let_two was put before let, c has "pz" and then that is repeated five times.
   :feedback_d: Think about the order that the program is executed in, what occurs first?
   :feedback_e: This is correct syntax and no errors will occur.
   :practice: T
   :topics: Sequences/ConcatenationandRepetition

   What will the output be for the following code?
  
   .. sourcecode:: python

    let = "z"
    let_two = "p"
    c = let_two + let
    m = c*5
    print(m)

    :language: python
    :practice: T
    :topics: Sequences/TheSliceOperator

    Write a program that extracts the last three items in the list ``sports`` and assigns it to the variable ``last``. Make sure to write your code so that it works no matter how many items are in the list.
    ~~~~
    sports = ['cricket', 'football', 'volleyball', 'baseball', 'softball', 'track and field', 'curling', 'ping pong', 'hockey']

   :answer_c: ['travel', 'lights']
   :answer_d: ['world', 'travel']
   :correct: c 
   :feedback_a: When we take a slice of something, it is inclusive of the first number and exclusive of the second.
   :feedback_b: When we take a slice of something, it is inclusive of the first number and exclusive of the second. Additionally, Python is a zero-index based language.
