Length
======

The ``len`` function, when applied to a string, returns the number of characters in a string.

.. activecode:: ac5_5_1

    fruit = "Banana"
    print(len(fruit))


To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like
this:

.. activecode:: ac5_5_2

    fruit = "Banana"
    sz = len(fruit)
    last = fruit[sz]       # ERROR!
    print(last)

That won't work. It causes the runtime error ``IndexError: string index out of range``. The reason is
that there is no letter at index position 6 in ``"Banana"``. Since we started counting at zero, the
six indexes are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, we have to subtract 1 from the length.
Give it a try in the example above.

.. activecode:: ac5_5_3

    fruit = "Banana"
    sz = len(fruit)
    lastch = fruit[sz-1]
    print(lastch)

.. Alternatively, in Python we can use **negative indices**, which count backward from the
.. end of the string. The expression ``fruit[-1]`` yields the last letter,
.. ``fruit[-2]`` yields the second to last, and so on.  Try it!

Typically, a Python programmer would combine lines 2 and 3 from the above example into a single line:

.. sourcecode:: python

    lastch = fruit[len(fruit)-1]


Though, from what you just learned about using negative indices, using ``fruit[-1]`` would be
a more appropriate way to access the last index in a list.

You can still use the ``len`` function to access other predictable indices, like the middle character of a string.

.. sourcecode:: python

    fruit = "grape"
    midchar = fruit[len(fruit)//2]
    # the value of midchar is "a"

As with strings, the function ``len`` returns the length of a list (the number of items in the list).
However, since lists can have items which are themselves sequences (e.g., strings),
it important to note that ``len`` only returns the top-most length.

.. activecode:: ac5_5_4

    alist =  ["hello", 2.0, 5]
    print(len(alist))
    print(len(alist[0]))

Note that ``alist[0]`` is the string ``"hello"``, which has length 5.
