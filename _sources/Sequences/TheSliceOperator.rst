The Slice Operator
------------------

A substring of a string is called a **slice**. Selecting a slice is similar to
selecting a character:

.. activecode:: ac5_6_1
    
    singers = "Peter, Paul, and Mary"
    print(singers[0:5])
    print(singers[7:11])
    print(singers[17:21])
    

The ``slice`` operator ``[n:m]`` returns the part of the string starting
with the character at index n and
go up to but *not including* the character at index m. 
Or with normal counting from 1, this is the (n+1)st character up to and including the mth character.

If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the
beginning of the string. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the
end of the string.

.. activecode:: ac5_6_2
    
    fruit = "banana"
    print(fruit[:3])
    print(fruit[3:])

What do you think ``fruit[:]`` means?

List Slices
===========

The slice operation we saw with strings also work on lists.  Remember that the first index is the starting point for the slice and the second number is one index past the end of the slice (up to but not including that element).  Recall also
that if you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the
beginning of the sequence. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the
end of the sequence.

.. activecode:: ac5_6_3
    
    a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
    print(a_list[1:3])
    print(a_list[:4])
    print(a_list[3:])
    print(a_list[:])


Tuple Slices
============

We can't modify the elements of a tuple, but we can make a variable reference a new tuple holding different information. 
Thankfully we can also use the slice operation on tuples as well as strings and lists. To construct the new tuple, we can 
slice parts of the old tuple and join up the bits to make the new tuple. So ``julia`` has a new recent film, and we might 
want to change her tuple. We can easily slice off the parts we want and concatenate them with the new tuple.

.. activecode:: ac5_6_4

    julia = ("Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia")
    print(julia[2])
    print(julia[2:6])

    print(len(julia))

    julia = julia[:3] + ("Eat Pray Love", 2010) + julia[5:]
    print(julia)

   :feedback_c: Yes, start with the character at index 3 and go up to but not include the character at index 8.
   :feedback_d: This is called slicing, not indexing. It requires a start and an end.
