Strings and Lists
=================

Throughout the first chapters of this book we have used strings to represent words or phrases that we
wanted to print out. Our definition was simple: a string is simply some characters inside quotes.  
In this chapter we explore strings in much more detail.

Additionally, we explore lists, which are very much like strings but can hold different types. In fact, you can think of a string as a list of characters!

Strings
-------

Strings can be defined as sequential collections of characters.  This means that the individual 
characters that make up a string are in a particular order from left to right.

A string that contains no characters, often referred to as the **empty string**, is still considered 
to be a string. It is simply a sequence of zero characters and is represented by '' or "" (two single 
or two double quotes with nothing in between).

Lists
-----

A **list** is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an
index. The values that make up a list are called its **elements**. Lists are similar to strings, which 
are ordered collections of characters, except that the elements of a list can have any type and for 
any one list, the items can be of different types.

List Values
-----------

There are several ways to create a new list.  The simplest is to enclose the
elements in square brackets ( ``[`` and ``]``).

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    [10, 20, 30, 40]
    ["spam", "bungee", "swallow"]

The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three
strings. As we said above, the elements of a list don't have to be the same type.  The following
list contains a string, a float, an integer, and
another list.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    ["hello", 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]

   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, unlike strings, lists can consist of any type of Python data.
   :feedback_b: Lists are heterogeneous, meaning they can have different types of data.

   A list can contain only integer items.
